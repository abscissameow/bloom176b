Let x be the number of cans that Jennifer bought. So, Mark bought x + 6 * 5 cans.Interchanging x + 6 to x gives x = x * 5 + 6Which is x = 6 x + 60.Subtracting 60 from both sides gives x = 6 xWe can add and subtract 6 together to find value of Mark's cans which equals 6 x = 6 (x-2 and 8 which equals x like so: 6 [(6-1) x - 8] = 6 (x-2) -7 x = 28 - 7 xThus, the number of cans of milk that Jennifer bought is x = 28 - 7 x=2.4 x = 28 - 28 x = 0.4The answer is 40.question:#

Let x be the number of cans Jennifer bought. Mark brought home x * 5 cans according to the statement.So, there were a total of x*20 cans - 6(x*5) cans.40 cans -7x(5 cans)= 6x - 7*5320 = 6x + 150.Distribute the 5 to cancel the 5x and 6x terms out and get 120 = 7x - 15.Therefore, the number of cans Jennifer bought is 7*53 - 15 = 30.The answer is 30.question:#

This is a slightly different problem since Mark is buying the same amount of milk as the number of cans Jennifer brought home, and therefore Mark would buy a number greater than 0.Let x be the number of cans that bothJennifer and Mark bought.ThenMark bought 5*6 + x cans, where x represents how many of Mark's cans are different from Jennifer's cans.Mark would buy 50 cansMark = 5*6 + xTherefore,2*x = 50x = 25,Jennifer bought 4x1 + x cans, where x and 1 represent the number of cans that are different from theirs.Jennifer would buy 40 cansJennifer = (4 + x)*(1 + x)Therefore,5x = 40 4x = 20The number of cans brought home became x = 20 cans.The answer is 20.question:#

Let D be the number of additional cans Jennifer bought.Then 40 + (6D/5) = 50.By substitution, we get 2D = 10.Simplifying, we get D = 10 / 2 = 5, so D is 5.Keeping the original expression, we get 5 + (6D/5) = 10 + 30/5 = 45.Therefore, Jennifer bought D + 40 cans  is 45 cans.The answer is 45.question:#

Let M be the number of cans Mark bought and let N be the number of cans Jennifer bought from the store. Mark bought 5 cans for every 6 Jennifer bought, so 6M = 5N.Translating to mathematical notation, we can write this as 4x(M) = 5(x + N). Evaluating this equation to solve for x, we get x = 3M. Conceptually, each purchase of 6 cans by Jennifer means that 3 cans were left over (or given away) which is why this evaluates to 3M. Therefore, Mark's purchase is 3x = 15M, so Jennifer purchased 15M - 6M - 6M = 9M cans of milk add  answer is 9.question:#

How many cans of milk did Mark buy? Mark bought 50 cans of milk so the answer is 50.How many additional cans did Jennifer buy? She bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought#

Let x be the number of cans of milk owned by Jennifer. Then x = 40 + 6x/5, where x/5 refers to the number of cans of Mark's.Put 6/5 in parentheses to move the denominator to the outermost part of the equation, giving x + 10 = 50.Then 6x = 60 - 10, which means x = 40 - 6*50/60 = 50/2 = 25.The answer is 25.question:#

Let x be the number of cans (including the 6 'bonus' cans) that Jennifer bought.So it represents the fraction x/40.Considering the number of cans like are relevant, Mark would purchase x \ 5 = 50/5 = 10 cans.Therefore, the number of cans that the two bought together is x + 50 \ 5 = 50 + 6 = 56 cans.Thus, the number of extra cans that Jennifer bought is x - 56 \ 40 = x - 6 \ 40 = 30 \ 40 = 6.The answer is 6.question:#

Let x be the number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home. Therefore x + 6 x 5 = 40. Dividing through by 5 gives 6 x x = 40to solve for x, we have: x = 5/2 = 2.Therefore, x = 5 can stands for x = 5 which means 2 + 5 + 5 = 12.Thus, x = 12.The answer is 12.#

Let x be the number of cans purchased by Jennifer. Because x equals 5 more than an integer multiple of 5, x must be a multiple of 5.So, x = 5 * y, where y is a nonnegative integer.The number of cans David bought is 50 - 6 * x = (- 6) * 5 * y + 50 which simplifies to 300 + 2 * y = 50.Because y is positive, 300 + 2 * y must equal 50 or more.Let t be the number of times that y must be multiplied by 5 to obtain that value.Then 50 = 300 + 2 * t.Solving for t yields t = (2 * 50)/300, or t = 26 because 2 * 50 is the same as 100 and 2 * 50/300 is the same as.1.1 and is a valid number.So, the number of times that y must be multiplied by 5 to reach 50 is 26.Therefore, Mark bought 50 cans of milk and Jennifer bought 26 more than 26 times as many as he bought because she bought 50 fewer cans#
