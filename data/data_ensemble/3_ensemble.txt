 Write part as x %, where x is the number of pages that Julie read. Let R % be the remaining pages. In order to read half of the remaining pages, she would need (100 - R) / 2 % of the total pages (120). By reading 12 pages yesterday, she has already read 12 * 100 / 100 % = 12 / 2 % = 6 / 2 % of the 120 pages.Julie read 12 pages yesterday. In order to read half of the remaining pages, she would need fraction (100 - R) / 2. Then, since she read x pages yesterday, the fraction 100 - R is also represented by 100 - x.Thus, she would need fraction (100 - x) / 2 = (#

 120 * 12 / 120 + 120 * 24 / 120 = 30 pagesToday, Julie read 2 x (120 * 12 / 120) = 24 pagesSo, she would have 72 pages remaining.To read half of these 72 pages, there would be 72/2 = 36 pages.To complete this task, she should read 16 pages.The answer is 16.question: Michael and Victor help their dad do work in the garden in his spare time.  Michael's father asked Michael to help his dad 1/3#

 Let W be the amount of pages that Julie would read tomorrow.Today, she read 12 pages so W - 12 = 48.On previous day she read 12 pages too so 12 + 12 + 12 = 48So, W = 48 + 12 = 60. If Julie wants to half of the remaining pages than she should read 30 pages.  So, to read half of that remaining amount, she would need to read 30/60 = 1/2 of 60.So she would need to read 30 + 12 = 42 pages.The answer is 42.question: How many apples did Franco give to Sophia if the number of apples he gave is the same as the times he gave?answer: Suppose M is the number of apples that Franco gave to Sophia.  Then#


 Let Y be the amount of pages that Julie still needs to read.Yesterday, she read 12 pages.So, we know Y = 120 - 12 = 108 pages.Now, we see that Julie read 2x = 24 pages today.So, X = 24Y = 24/(2x) = 24/2Y = 24/108 = 2.4/4Y = Y / 45 = 108 / 45 = 24 pages.So Julie needs to read 24 pages tomorrow to finish half of the remaining pages and they will be 120 - 24 = 96 pages left.The answer is 24.question: Janice was reading a book when 14 pages fell off on the ground.

 She read 12 pages yesterday and 12 * 2 = 24 pages today.She's halfway through a 120 page book, so she should read 60 pages tomorrow.Then she will have read the entire book.So if there are 120 pages, 60 will be half of the number of pages. If there are p pages in a book, then the number of pages in the book is 2p.The answer is 60 pages.question: Brian has to sweep a portion of his street 120 meters long.However,#

 Let Q be the number pages read on Tuesday. The remaining pages PS that she is reading today is 120 - Q.The pages read on Tuesday is half of PS, so we can write PS = 2(120 - Q).Now divide both sides by 2 to remove fractions, and we get 120 - 2Q = PS.Therefore, Q is 60 pages.If she reads PU pages on tomorrow, half of the remaining pages, the number of pages that she has to read is PS/2 = 120 - 2Q/2 = 120 - 30 = 90.To solve for PU, we can do PU = 90 + 30 = 120 pages. The answer is 120 pages.question: Jessica bought 9 items of clothing and then gave her older sister half#

 She can read (1/2 of remaining pages) + 12 pages = 15 pages. It's the same as 15/12 pages which is the same as 1.25 pages per day + 12 pages. So for today, 1.25 + 12 = 13.25 and for tomorrow, she should read 15 pages. The answer is 15 pages.Since quite time, Mathseeds in America are interested in young mathematicians of various ages who solve mathematical problems and problems to help them gain confidence.

 Yesterday, Julie read page number x. And today, she read 2x pages number. Let x refer to the number of pages that Julie read.Then the expression simplifies to 2x - 4x + x/2.Simplifying this further brings us to x(x - 2) + x/2 = 120.Distributing x within parentheses and x/2 gives x(x-2) + x(4 - 2x) = 120.Adding x-3/2 in each term and combining like terms one gets.200/6 - 17/2 = 120.Taking each 7/3 into a y term, the resulting solution is the equation y + 3/2 = 120.Thus, twice the amount is equal to 3.So, the number of pages that were read is 6#


 Since there are 120 pages, 120 puts a constraint on the number of pages that are read now or in the future.Also, the half-Leibniz expression states that there a half day left so 60 hours were spent reading. Then we know that 170/2 - 60 = 40. To follow the half expression, there are 40 hours remaining.However, 40 hours are not enough to read the remaining pages so 40 x 120/(10 x 12) = 16 pages were read.Therefore, the answer is 16 pages.Now you should be able to choose any arithmetic, geometric, or number progression questions and look up what is my pattern and you can start solving ahead of the question.

Here is the question#


Let x be the number of pages Julie read.Let y be the number of pages left to read.Since she read 12 pages yesterday, it would be 12 + 2x = 120.x + y = 120, so that 2x + y = 120.Substituting the last equation gives 2(2x + y) = 120.Adding 2 times both sides yields 4x + 4y = 240.And multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 yields 4(x + y) = 240.Substituting the values of y, we have 4x + 4(120 - 2x) = 240.This becomes 8x + 120 - 16x = 240.Multiplying both sides of the equation by 8 yields 16x - 160 = 240.Divide both sides of the equation by 2 and use subtraction rather than division: 12x = 240.This gives us the expression x = 12 + 4x = 120.Therefore, the remaining pages to read are 120 - x = 96.The answer is 96. question 1: My friends and I love to eat ice cream.
