Let x be the number of more pieces of candy that Anna gets.Since Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house, he gets 11 * 75 = 825 pieces of candy.Therefore, Anna gets (14 + x) * 60 = 14 * 60 + x * 60 = 1460 + x * 60.The first equation is 825 - 1460 = -180 which is -(14x + 60).So the final equation is 11 * 75 = 825 - 14x - 60.Then, let y = 11 and the equation becomes y - 14x - 60 = -825.Factoring out 14 yields (14 + 14)(x + 1) = 825.Using the distributive property on the second term, we get (x + 1) * 14 = 825.Then, isolate x by subtracting 1 from both sides so it becomes 14x = 825 - 14.Solve for x by subtracting 14 from both sides so the equation becomes x = 650 - 14 = 636.The answer is 636 pieces of candy.The answer is 636.The next set of questions can be found on my other blog entry by visiting this link#

Let A be the number of pieces of candy that Anna gets. So the total number of pieces of candy that Anna and Billy get would be A + B. Each subdivision has a different number of houses so we can assume that B = (60 - 60)/(14 - 11) = 25 pieces of candy.Then the total number of pieces of candy that Anna and Billy get would be A + B = 25 + A.But the total number of houses in the subdivision is 60 + 75 = 115 houses. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy that Anna gets would be A = (115 - 25) / (14 - 11) = 41 pieces of candy.The answer is 41.question: Ted, Meg, Kayleigh, Jason,#

Let x be the number of houses that Anna visits. Then 14 x - 11 x = 60 - 75.Adding -x to both sides produces 14 x - 11 x = 75.Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation, and the remaining expression is 14 x = 65.The number of houses that Anna visited is x = 65 - 11 = 54.The answer is 54 houses.question:#

Let A be the number of pieces of candy that Anna gets.Then the total number of pieces of candy that they get is 14A + 11B.The number of houses in the first subdivision is 60.The number of houses in the second subdivision is 75.The first subdivision has 60 houses, and the second subdivision has 75 houses. So the total number of houses is 105 houses. Thus, the expression becomes 14A + 11B = 105.Subtract 11A from both sides to obtain 14A = 105 - 11A.Then subtract A from both sides of the equation to obtain 105A - 105A = 0.Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to get A = 5.Therefore, the answer is 5.question: Jack and#

Let's say that x is the number of houses in the second subdivision.Let the number of houses in the first subdivision be y, so we have x + y = 75 houses.On the second subdivision, Anna gets 11x and Billy gets 11y pieces of candy.Then we can say that 11x + 14y = 14(x + y)Here, y is a constant, so it doesn't matter if we do the operation first or second, so we say 11x + 14y = 14(x + y).Subtract 11x from both sides, leaving 14y = 14(x + y) - 11x = 14 - 11x = 3yTherefore, the number of houses in the second subdivision is x = 75 - 3 = 72.The answer is 72.question: Tammy has two bags of hockey pucks, a big bag that#

Let x be the number of houses in the first subdivision.If Anna gets 14 pieces of candy from each house and her brother Billy gets 11 pieces of candy from each house, how many total pieces of candy do they get?x + (x + x + x +...) = x + x +... + 2x + x +... + x + 11 = 14 + 2x + x +... = 14 + 2x + x +... + 2x + x +... = 14 + 2x +... + 2x +... + 2x +... + 11 = 2x + 14 + 11 + 2x + x +... + 2x + x +... + x = 2x + 14 + 2x + x +... + 2x +... + 2x +... + 11 = 2x + 14 + 2x +... + 14 + 2x +... + 11 = (2x + 11) + 14 = 2x + 11 + 14 = 2x + 15.There are 60 houses in the first subdivision and 75 houses in the second subdivision.Therefore, there are 60x + 75x = 1275 houses.The answer is 75x.The answer is 25 more pieces of candy for Anna.The#

Let X be the number of pieces of candy that Anna gets more than Billy. Since each subdivision has 30 houses and Anna goes to 60 houses and Billy goes to 75 houses, the expression (60 + 30) - (75 + 30) = 30 - 15 = 15 is the number of houses that Anna goes to more than Billy. Since there are 15 more houses that Anna goes to than Billy, X = 15.From 14 per house, Anna gets 15 X pieces of candy more than Billy. Since each house has 14 + 15 X pieces of candy, the expression 14 + 15 X = 14 + 15 * (14 + 15) / 30 = 14 + (15 X) / 30 is the total number of pieces of candy.Since there are 60 + 30 houses, 14 + (15 X) / 30 X = 15 X.Therefore, the number of candy that Anna gets is 60 + 30 X.The answer is 30.question: Eddie and Alvin#

Let x be the number of houses in the first subdivision.Let B be the number of houses in the second subdivision.So, x + B = 60.Therefore, x = 60 - B.Since x + B = 60 and 14 + 11 = 25, x - B = 60 - B - 25.Solving for x gives x = 35.Therefore, B = 25 - 35 = -10. The number of extra candies Anna gets is 10.The answer is 10.question: Anna and Billy get 14 and 11 pieces of candy #

Let x be the number of houses in the subdivision that Billy goes trick-or-treating in.So there are 60 houses where Anna goes trick-or-treating. So there are 60x houses in both subdivisions.The total number of pieces of candy in both subdivisions is (14x + 11y).The houses in the subdivision that Anna goes trick-or-treating in have 14x pieces of candy.The houses in the subdivision that Billy goes trick-or-treating in have 11y pieces of candy.When Billy goes trick-or-treating, he doesn't get any of the houses that Anna goes trick-or-treating in so 14x - 11y = 60x.Therefore, 20x = 60x so x = 3.Therefore, the number of houses where Billy goes trick-or-treating in is 3.The answer is 14 pieces of candy.question#

Let A be the number of pieces of candy that Anna got and b be the number of pieces of candy that Billy got.So there are (a + b) * 60 houses and (a + b) * 75 houses.Solving for a and b gives 14 * 60 = a + b + 75 * b = a + 150.Combining the like terms on the left side produces a = 300.Now transferring 300 to the right side gives 300 = a + 150.Now, we can get the value of a using the equation 300 = 150 + a.To get the value of a we can subtract 150 from both sides to get 150 = a - 50.Thus, a = 75 pieces of candy.Therefore, the number of extra pieces of candy that Anna gets are 75.The answer is 75.question: Edgar bought a new pair of tennis shoes.#
