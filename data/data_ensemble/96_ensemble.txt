Dimensional analysis helps here.15*Inch*4 = Inch = $4.50 per gallon$3*Inch*2 = Inch = $2.50 per gallonGoing off this, the solution is $4.50*(Inch - 1)*(Inch - 2) - 2.50*(Inch -1) = $90 - $27 = $63Thus the answer is $63 questionmark: Barnaby is good at keeping checkout receipts.

If w is the number of gallons  on Tuesday  and w1 is the number of gallons on Monday, then 15w1 - 3w = 4.15w - 7w = 60.Then 9w - 2 = 60.15w1 (1 + 7/3) = 60.9w1 + w1 - 18w1 = 60.w1 = 60 / (15 + 14) = 9.Then the new expression is 15w1 = 4 so w1 = 1.Therefore, the number of gallons on Monday is w = 3.The answer is B=45 and it is possible that Mozzart collects wa=3+ga=113.Similarly, we get b=5 which means Byron earns 50.The answer is 0.question#

Let x be the amount of money he made.Then 4 x + 3 x = 15 thus 10 x = 30.But, 10 x could also be written as 0.3 x so x = 3.Then, x * 1.2 = 4.So, he made $0.6 dollars in the two days.The answer is $0.6.question:#

We can look at this as an algebra equation by plugging in y in the place of pounds.So: l * FYGG = W    from abovequestion: Donna bought flowers at one dollar each but paid $4.43 to Saks.

Overall, He collected 4 x 15 + 3 x 15 = 60 gallons or 180L.Because he can sell the water for $1.2 per gallon, he can earn 60 x $1.2 = $72.That makes his total worth of water is 60 + 72 = $132.The answer is $132.question:#

We will use m for inches in Monday and t for inches in Tuesday. Let G be the number of gallons of water. Then 4 * 15 = 60 and 3 * 15 = 45.Let N be the number of gallons from Monday and Y be the number of gallons from Tuesday. Then 60 = 4 + (3 * N) = 4 + 3 * N.Adding 3 to both sides gives 4 + 3N = 3 + 3(N + 1). grouping the 3 gives 4 + 3N = 3 + 4N. which simplify to N = 0.3.Now, T = (3 * Y), 60 - i = 15T, and Y = 4.Therefore, G = 107 gallons. We will let x be the number of gallons that James sold.  Then x = G - i = 107 - 4 = 107 - 4 - 3 = 107 - 6 = 97 -x = 15 - T = 15 - 3 = 12 -x = 6.So, he sold 6 gallons.The answer is $6.question:#

On Monday he collected 4 x 15 = 60 gallons.On Tuesday his collection would be 3 x 15 = 45 gallons.The total amount collected in gallons would be 90 gallons.The total amount in money would be $1.2 x 90 = $108.The answer is $108.question:#

4 x 15 = 1 ft then 1 ft x.15 = 30 gallons.  4 x 15 = 1 ft then 1 ft x.15 = 30 gallons. 3 x 15 = 1 ft then 1 ft x.15 = 30 gallons.Adding both gives 70 gallons Monday and 30 gallons Tuesday. In all, he had 100 gallons Monday and 30 gallons Tuesday. 4 x 15 = 3 gallons then 3 gallons x 1.2 = $3.6 Monday. 30 gallons x 1.2 = 36 gallons Tuesday.  70 gallons x 1.2 = 84 gallons Monday 30 gallons x 1.2 = 36 gallons Tuesday. Answer is $3.6 + 3.6 = $7.2. The answer is $7.2.â€‹#

Let W be the dollars made.  Then (W = $ 1.2 x 15 x (4 + 5) - 4 = $ 1.2 x 15 x 9 - 4$ 1.2 x 3 x 9 - 9 = $ 48, - $ 9$ 1.2 x 15 x 9 - 1.2 x 3 x 9 = $48 - 9$ 1.2 x 15 = $360In the previous day's rainfall (4 inches + 5 inches = 9) must have collected $360 for the day. The total time taken 4 + 5 = 9 and the total rain from the day before is $360.9 times the rain on Monday is $360, and 3 times the rain on Tuesday is $360. Monday must have had 4 inches of rain,Tuesday had have had 3 inches of rain, and Tuesday had 9 inches of rain, Translate 45 into its proper binary expression with base 2.answerBinary expression = 1^1 + 0*2^0 + 1^1 + 0^2 + 1*1 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4The answer is 45.0 = 0 wouldn't be the case if we would substitute 0 for James, now it#

Let hbe the number of inches of rain that the storm dumped.  Then daysUntil "The storm that poured in" was h + 4 + 3 = 8.60 - (h + 11) gallons = 0 gallons.40 gallons = h + 10For each gallon he sells, he loses 10 cents leaving him with a net profit of 80 - 100h = 40 - h dollars.He sells 1 gallon for 80 - 100h = 10 + h cents.If he sells only 40 gallons, he loses 80 - 100 = 0 = $1.2h times 40 gallons.So the total amount of money you get is $2.4h + 8.0h = 2.4 + h.The author believes the correct answer is $2.76.question:#
