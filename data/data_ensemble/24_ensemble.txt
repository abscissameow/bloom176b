Let x be the number of dollars left over after buying on Saturday and on Tuesday.Then, she spent $100 - 15 - 23 = 66 dollars.The remaining dollars she has is x + 100 - spent $15 and $23 on Tuesday and Thursday respectively.So, 15x + 23 = $79 * 2 = $170 or 15x + 23 = (x + 79)(x + 7)After substituting x + 79 for x, we get, 170x + 23 = 2(x + 79)Since x + 79 is common, the expression simplifies to 170 + 23 = 173Thus, the number of dollars left over on Monday is x + 7 = $78$.And, the amount of credit that Mary needs before her next shopping trip is $78 + $78 = $168$.The answer is 168.question: Jason uses a formula to determine how long it#

Let C be the amount of credit needed. So, C = 15 + 23 = 38.The expression becomes 100 - C = 52.Let us find 52 - C = -38.Now transfer 100 to the left side, so 100 - C = 52 + 100 = 152.Now, change the signs and transfer 52 to the right side, so 52 + 100 = 100 - 52.Simplay and Thursday respectively.So, 15x + 23 = $79 * 2 = $170 or 15x + 23 = (x + 79)(x + 7)After substituting x + 79 for x, we get, 170x + 23 = 2(x + 79)Since x + 79 is common, the expression simplifies to 170 + 23 = 173Thus, the number of dollars left over on Monday is x + 7 = $78$.And, the amount of credit that Mary needs before her next shopping trip is $78 + $78 = $156.The answer is $156.question: John decided to build an addition table.

Let C be the amount of credit that Mary will have to pay before her next shopping trip. Then the amount of credit she has left is $100 - C.On Tuesday, she paid 15 dollars of credit.The amount of credit left at the end of the day is 100 - C - 15 = 85.On Thursday, she paid 23 dollars of credit.The amount of credit left at the end of the day is 100 - C - 23 = 77.Adding 15 and 23, we get 82.So 85 + 77 + 15 + 23 = 82. This means that 85 = C.Since 85 = C, C = 85.The answer is 85.question: Shelley went to the#

Let x be the credit she needs.Then the total credit she spent is 100 - x.If she spent $100 on Monday, that means she paid 100 - x = 100 dollars.She paid 15 dollars on Tuesday. That is 100 - x - 15 = 85.She paid 23 dollars on Thursday. That is 85 + 23 = 100.There is no debt, therefore x = 10.The answer is 10.question: Under the tree in the corner of the playground, the children saw 12#

Let x be the amount of credit that Mary needs to pay. Since x = $15 - $23, her credit balance is $0.She is left with $0 to pay on Friday, so the credit needed to pay for her shopping is x = $30.The answer is $30.question: Sarah had#

Let x be the number of dollars left on Saturday.So x = 100 - 15 - 23.To solve for x we have 100 = x + 15 + 23.This equation can be divided by 2 so we have 50 = x + 7.Simplifying the equation we have 2 = 2 + x.Then x = 2.Therefore, on Saturday, Mary has 2 credit.The answer is 2.#



t C be the amount of credit she needs to pay.Then 15C + 23C = 100.In this case, if there is too much credit for one shop, then the extra can be used for another one.So, if we add 15 + 23 = 38C to both sides of the equation, then we get 38C = 100.Then, we distribute 38 to the left side so we get 15C + 23C = 38C + 100.This gives us 15C + 23C = 38 + 100.Then we subtract the two quantities from each other so we get (15C) + (23C) - (38C) - (100) = 0.This is the same as saying 15C + 23C - 38C - 100 = 0.Distributing the negative to the left side gives 15C - 38C = -100.Then 15C + 23C = 38 + 100.The answer is 100.question: Mickey has six Pokemon cards. It cost Mickey a total of $80 to buy the#

Let C be the amount that Mary paid.From the given information, we know that $(x + 15) + (x + 23) = C$Therefore, x + 23 + x = C.Subtracting 23 from both sides gives x + x = C - 23.Then add 23 to both sides of the equation to produce x + 23 + 23 = C + 23.Then we can solve for x by dividing each side by 2, x = C/(23 + 23).Thus the value of x is equal to C/(23 + 23).Since C = $100 then x = 100/(23 + 23).The answer is x = 100/(23 + 23).question: Gwen is filling a clear plastic bottle with orange juice and sweetened with#

We can refer to the formula for finding the remainder in base 2.So, the full credit would be $(100 - 15) 2 = 100 - 15 = $85.Thus, 85 â€“ 23 = 62.She will need to pay 62 of credit.The answer is 62.#

Mary spent $85 on Saturday, which is $85 / 2 = $42 on Tuesday. $85 - ($42 + $23) = $42.Therefore, $42 / 2 = $20 on Thursday.Thus, $85 - ($20 + $15) = $55.If Mary had to spend the $42 today then she would have spent $55 next Saturday.The answer is 55.question: Holly bought a phone at Amazon for $56.99 and paid $32#
