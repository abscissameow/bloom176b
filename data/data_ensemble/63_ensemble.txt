Let x be the number of rest situps. First day she did 12 - x, so she did another (12 - x) on Tuesday. Since 12 - x + (12 - x) = 30 (the goal), we get 12 - x + 12 - x = 30x + 12 - 2x = 30Since 12 - 2 = 10, we get 12 - 2x = 30x Therefore, x = 10 - x/2 = 10- (19/12) = 7/2.So she would have to do 7 = 21 situps.The answer is 21.question:#

Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps.  To know if she meets her goal, we see that 30 = 30 - 12 + 15 = 5(20). Shawna only fails to do 12 situps on Monday. Therefore, she needs to do 20 situps more on Tuesday. She does 21 on Tuesday, but only 19 on Wednesday. Therefore, Shawna again has to do 20 situps more on Wednesday so that she meets her minimum goal of 30. Thus, on Wednesday she will do 51 situps to complete the situps needed. The answer is 51. question Star waiting#

Tuesday, Shawna did 12 plus 19 = 31 situps so she did not meet her goal that she wanted to do. Now agree that x will be the number of situps that she needs on Wednesday so that her goal is met.On Monday she did 12 situps so she started with 12 situps on Monday.The necessary condition that she needs to meet her goal is that x = 12 + 31 = 43 situps.Now subtract 43 from the rest of the equation to get 45 - x = 12 situps, so we need 31 situps more. She does not meet her goal on Wednesday that she said she would meet.The answer is 31.question:#

Shawna's goal is 30 situps so we know the number of situps that she must do on Tuesday and Wednesday (30 + x = 30 + 19 = 49)Tuesday's = 19 (missed)Wednesday's = 49 (17 to make up)Tuesday's = 19 - 17 (old) + x (17 = 17 - x)Wednesday's = 19 - x (missed) + x (new)Tuesday's = x + x + x + x w = x*( x + 4) = x*5 = x*5 + x = 3x + 5?(x=9.x=5 is not a possible answer)Wednesday's = 9 + 5 (to make up)Or, 2x + 2 = 2 +x(this could of been an answer).June 26#

The workouts for Tuesday and Wednesday count as one workout in terms of achieving her goal and making up for the rest.a separate workout would be Monday; the overall goal is 30 Ã— 2 = 60 situps since the goal is to do this workout twice a week.12 situps of Monday + 19 situps of Tuesday + abs missing from 19 situps of Tuesday. How many abs do we regain with extra situps we do on Wednesday? the abs from 19 minus the abs we already have from 12 = abs regained on Wednesday (9-1-1)/9 = 8 situps. therefore, 60 - 8 - 19/9 = 34 situps.The answer is 34.question:#

Let X be the number of situps Shawna does on Wednesdays.She did 12 situps on Monday, a Y on day 2, and did a 2 less on day 2 than what she did on day one (the second day). Thus:Y = 2 [She did twice as many, i.e. 12 + 2] or Y = 4. (this was her minimum goal)She ran off another X on day 3. This is her target:X + 12 = 30So, X = 22.She did 12 + 6 + 4 = 22, not counting the number on day 1. Thus, she did 22+2 = 24 situps.The answer is 24.question:#

Shawna has 12 on Monday so her goal would be 30 - 12 = 18 on Wednesday.Then she has 19 on Tuesday so her Tuesday goal is 30 - 19 = 11.As Shawna has 19 on Tuesday and her goal is 11 on Tuesday, we can conclude that Shawna met her goal on Tuesday (she was above it).The answer is 11.question:#

Let A be the number situps that Shawna had to do on Wednesday in order to meet the minimum goal. So, A = 27 - 12 + 19 = 32 Which means A + 12 - 19 = 32Converting that rearranged expression to words is "The sum of the day before the day before the day before...." This comes down to the final result of A + 3 - 1 = 32, where A = 32 - 3 = 29 which is the number of situps to do on Wednesday (Wednesday before Tuesday).The answer is 39.question:#

12 + 19 = 31It's an equation of linear increase so can be shown as: y = 500 + 89 x = 500 + 89(x + 1).Therefore y = (x + 1)(500 + 89).We know the total of situps Shawna is trying to do = 31 + 31 = 62.Then: 62 = 31 + 31 = (x + 1). x + 1 = 31 62 + 31 31 = 111 x = 51.541 situps.Therefore, Shawna would have to do exactly 51 situps to make up for the 9 more situps she didn't do on Tuesday.The answer is 51 situps.question:#

Shawna has a total of 30 situps, with 12 on Monday, 19 on Tuesday, and needs to make it up on Wednesday. Let x be the number of situps that Shawna requires on Wednesday.Thus, Shawna did 12 + 19 + x = 30 situps.To add the 12 to the 19 we have 30 + 12 - 19 = 30 + x = 30 + 12 - 26For negative numbers, add them and then subtract the number that was at the end. 12 + 19 + x = 30 + 12 - 26So the result of x is 12 - 26 = -4, since this is the number of situps that Shawna has to make up.The answer is -4.question:#
