Let x be the previous monthly income.She was spending 40% of her income on rent and utilities.So the equation is x/40 = 0.25.Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.25 produces x = 8.Thus, the previous monthly income was $8.The answer is $8.question: Keoni earns $5 per hour working at his new job. He expects to#

Before her pay increase, Mrs. Snyder spent $4,000 (40%) of her salary on rent and utilities.$600 is 25% of her new salary, so her previous salary was $5400.The answer is 5,400.question: What time of day will you get to# 
Let x be her previous monthly income. Her current monthly income is 2400 - 300 = 2100.If the current monthly income is 25% of her current monthly income, her previous monthly income was 2100 * 4/5 = 1625.The answer is 1625.question: Wendy had 6 crayons,#

Let M be the amount of her monthly income. Let r be the amount she paid for rent and u be the amount she paid for utilities.Then the equation would be M = r + u.Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her income on rent and utilities, so the equation would be 40 * M = r + u.Solving for M gives M = 40 * (r + u) / (1 - 0.40) = 600 / 0.25Now that M is known, we can find r + u.Thus, r + u = 600 / 0.25 - 40 * 600 / 0.25 = 600 / 0.25 = 300 / 0.25 = 12 / 0.25 = 48.Therefore the amount of rent and utilities is M - 48 = $42.The previous salary was M - 48 = $42.The answer is $42.#

Let M be the previous monthly income. She spent 40% of M on rent and utilities. Thus the rent and utilities are 0.4 * M. We know that M and M + 600 are both less than 0.25 * M, and so the rent and utilities must remain the same.Thus, the rent and utilities is still 0.4 * M.Because the rent and utilities has remained the same, the expression becomes 0.4 * (M + 600).So, 0.4 * (M + 600) = 0.25 * M.Multiply both sides by 0.25 to get 0.4 * M = 0.25 * M.Transfer 0.4 to the other side to obtain M = 0.4 * 0.25 * M.Finally, divide both sides by 0.4 to obtain M = 60.Therefore, her monthly income was M = 60 before the raise.The answer is 60.question: After planting a tree and decorating#

Let x be the previous monthly income.Then the new monthly income is 600 + x.The new monthly income is 25% of the new monthly income, so the equation is 600 + x = 0.25(600 + x).Then distribute 600 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(600 + x) = 0.25(1200).Then combine the like terms on the left side, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(1200) = 0.25(1200) + 0.25(x).Then distribute 0.25 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(1200) + 0.25(x).Then combine the like terms on the left side, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(1200) + 0.25x.Then distribute 0.25 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(1200) + 0.25(x) = 0.25(1200) + 0.25x.Then combine the like terms on the left side, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(1200) + 0.25x.Then distribute 0.25 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 600 + x = 0.25(1200) + 0.25x.Then distribute 0.25 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 600 + x =#

Let x be her previous monthly income.So her new monthly income would be (x + 600) * (1 - 0.25) = (x + 600) * 0.75.Now we can divide both sides by (x + 600) to get (1 - 0.25)/x = 0.75.Now we can distribute 0.25 to both sides to get (1 - 0.25)x = 0.75x - 0.25x = 0.75 * x.So the amount of her previous monthly income would be 0.75 * x/0.75 = 1.25 * x.Therefore, her previous monthly income is 1.25 * x = $1225/month.The answer is $1225.#

Let M be the previous monthly income.So M = 400 + 600 = $1000.Mrs. Snyder now spends 25% of her monthly income, so P = 200.Multiply both sides by 4 to get 4000 = P x 4.To solve for P, solve for 4,400 = P x 4.Therefore, P = 1000/4 = 250.Therefore, her previous monthly income was M = 250.The answer is 250.question: Ann and Bruce each has $10 coins#

Let A be the previous monthly income. So the monthly income after the raise is 600 + A. The amount used on rent and utilities before the raise was 400A. But now it's (400 + 600)A.The previous amount spent on rent and utilities is therefore: (400 + 600)A = 400A.Because 400A is a constant, it can be cancelled out of the equation.Solving for A produces the previous monthly income A = 400 / (600 + 400) = 200.The answer is 200.question: Mr. Brown fills his gas tank with 32 gallons#

Let x be the previous monthly income.The rent and utilities cost x *.25 = x * 0.4 = 0.4x of the monthly income.When her salary was increased by $600, the rent and utilities became 0.4x + $600 * 0.25 = $150.When dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4x, we get 1.75 = $150/0.4x.The previous monthly income was 1.75 * 0.4 = 0.75 * 0.4 = 0.3 times the salary.The previous monthly income was 0.3 * 600 = $200.The answer is 200.question: Lisa and Lana decided to pool their#
