Let y be the number of paintings he sells this month.For large paintings, 8 large paintings + 4 small paintings = y large paintings = 8y.For small paintings, 4 large paintings + 8 small paintings = y small paintings = 4x.The equation for large paintings is 8y = 8y + 4x = 20y = 20x.The equation for small paintings is 4x = 4x + 8y = 20x = 20y.Combining like terms on the left side of the two equations yields 20x = 20y.Next, add 20 to both sides of the equation to yield 40x = 40y.Solve for y and get y = 20 paintings.The answer is 20 paintings.question: Joseph is having problems with his teacher.
