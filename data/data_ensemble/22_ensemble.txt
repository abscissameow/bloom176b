Let C be the number of letters in Samantha's last name. Then Jamie's last name has 2C letters. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey so there are 2C + 1 letters in her last name.Bobbie's last name has C letters. And Samantha's last name has C + 2 letters. Therefore, C + 2 = 2C + 1.Simplifying we have 2C + 1 = 2(C + 2) = 2C + 2 so C = 3.So Samantha's last name has 3 + 2 = 5 letters.The answer is 5.question: Let#

Let x be the number of letters in Samantha's last name.Then x + 2 * x = 3 * x + 2 = x + 6.Since Bobbie took two letters off her name, her name has 6 letters.Therefore, Samantha's name has x = 2 letters.The answer is 2.question: Everyone needs a break sometimes. Ashley often makes the sandwiches and takes them to school. This is#

To calculate the number of letters in Samantha's last name, we first find the number of letters in Bobbie's last name and subtract 2.Let x be the number of letters in Bobbie's last name.Let y be the number of letters in Samantha's last name.Then we have 2*(x-2) = y.To solve this equation, we have to separate variables so the equation becomes 2x - 2 = y.Then we have x = y + 2.Since x is the number of letters in Bobbie's last name, so x = y + 2 would be twice the length of Jamie's last name.Therefore, the length of Samantha's last name is y = 2(y+2) = 2y + 4.To solve for y, we have 2y + 4 = y.The length of Samantha's last name is y = 4.Therefore, Samantha's last name is 4 letters long.The answer is 4.question: There are 24 blue cars and#

Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. So the number of letters in her last name is g + y = 8.Samantha's last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. So Samantha's last name has 3 more letters than Jamie's last name.So, the number of letters in Samantha's last name is 8 + 3 = 11 letters.The answer is 11.question#

Let a represent the number of letters in Samantha’s last name, and let x represent the number of letters in Bobbie’s last name. Then x + x = Jamie’s name, and x + x - 2x = Samantha’s name. And Jamie’s last name is 5 times longer than Samantha’s last name. Therefore, 25 = 2x + a. Solve for x, and there are 10 letters in Bobbie’s last name.There are 20 letters in Samantha’s last name.The answer is 20.question: A flock of seagulls flew southward from Tampa, Florida, and#

Let S be the number of letters in Samantha's last name and let T be the number of letters taken off by Bobbie. So 2T + S is twice the length of Jamie’s last name. Jamie's last name has 5 letters so it equals 2T + 5.Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives 2T + S = 2(T + 1).Then 2T = 2(T + 1).This is a linear equation so T = 2. So the number of letters in Samantha's last name is S = 7.The answer is 7.question:#

Let B be the number of letters in Samantha’s last name and let C be the number of letters in Jamie’s last name.Then, Samantha's last name has B - 2 - C letters. And Bobbie’s last name has (B - 2) letters.If Bobbie took C letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s last name which has (B - C) letters.So Bobbie's last name has C = B + 2 - (B - C) letters.And Jamie’s last name has B - C letters.Therefore, B = C + 2 - C = 3 - C.Substituting in C for B and C + 2 for B, produces 3 = C + 2 - C. This simplifies to C = 1.And the number of letters in Samantha's last name is 3 - 1 = 2 letters.The answer is 2.question: John has 300 $ notes in his wallet. One day#

Let x be the number of letters in Samantha's last name.Since Jamie's last name has two more letters than Bobbie's, we have 2*x letters.However, Bobbie took two letters off her last name so the difference in the length of their last names is 2x.This gives us 2*x - 2x = 2x.Multiplying both sides by 2 and combining constants, we have 2 - 2 = 0.Therefore, there are 0 letters in Samantha's last name.The answer is 0.question: Can you beat the average of the 3 teams that participated in the field hockey championship#

Let x be the number of letters in Samantha’s last name.Let y be the number of letters in Bobbie’s last name.Then Jamie's full name is x+y letters long.If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, then y = x - 2.Thus x + (x - 2) = x + 2 = 2x.Solving for x we get x = 2 and the length of Samantha's last name is 2 + x = 2x letters long.There are 4 letters in Bobbie's last name. The total number of letters is x + y + 4 = x + 4x = 6x = 6. Therefore, the number of letters in Samantha's last name is 2 + 6 = 8 letters long.The answer is 8.question: On his way to#

Let X be the number of letters in Samantha’s last name. Jamie’s last name has X+2 letters and Bobbie’s last name has X letters. Jamie took 2 letters from her last name so her last name has X+2 - 2 letters.The full name of Jamie Grey has X+2 letters and Samantha’s last name has X letters. The sum of both must be equal to the full name of Jamie Grey's last name.The sum is X+2 - 2 + X = X + 2, and solving for X gives X = 2 letters. The answer is 2.#
