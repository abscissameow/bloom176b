Let x be the average allowance.Then, one-third of x should be the average allowance from the students getting $6 a day. That would mean one-third of x times 2/3 = 4/serce.The total amount of money calculated would be 4/serce times 2/3 or $3 each for those getting $6 a day.The total amount of money calculated should be 53 * $3 = $162.adding up with the remaining 1/3 of x (that's the average allowance from the other students getting $4 a day) times one-third gives us x * 1/3 = 12 serceWe have only 60 students getting the allowance so the total amount of money that they would get a day is $162 + 12 serce = $174 serceThe answer is $174 serce.question:#

The total amount of money they get in a day is $6 x 2/3 + $4 x 2/3 + X x (1/3)$. So it follows that $6 \times 2/3 + 4 \times 2/3 + X \times 1/3 = 6000$So that: $6 \times 2/3 + 4 \times 2/3 + (X - 8) \times 13 = 6000$Then, cancel 6 and 4 and simplify: $9 \times X + 4 \times 13 = 6000$We can simplify further: $3 \times X + 25 = 6000$Multiplying out $3 \times X + 25$: $3 \times X + 3 \times 25$: $3 \times X + 75$: $X + 50$ = 6000.So $30 \times X = 6000$Or $30 \times X = 6000 - 50$: $X = 6000 - 5000 / 30$: $X = 625$.The answer is a total of $62500$, which over a school-year could represent a considerable.#

Let E (x) = equally likely A=15, B=10, C=5What is the expectation of this random variable? The expectation is just the mean we are averaging out the sixes and the fours, the sixes are exactly twice the foursso we can rewrite it as so the average amount of allowance the young boy(if you replace x with an f.F(x) is the probability the boy who receives y for his allowance.Where y is any integer between one and sixWhat is the probability of getting exactly x? Let q(x) be the probability that the student receives exactly xTherefore,Use the binomial expansion, Slicing the xSlicing the x to get a probabilitythat when we divide by sixtythat is exactly the probability we want, that means all outcomes has a twenty percent chance to occurThe left sum is 60%, so 1/8,#

Let x be the total money received by all the studentsThe middle school students average $6 per day and x/6 = 40$ per day for 2/3 of the students. So the money received by 2/3 of the students is 40 * 2 + 40 * 2 + 40 * 2 + 40 * 2 = 640$. 2/3 of the students get an average of $4 allowance per day and 20$ per day for all the students, so the amount of money received by all the students is 100 * 2 + 100 * 2 + 100 * 2 = $200.The total daily earnings of the students is 640 + 200 = 880$.The answer is 880.question:#

Let y be the number of students whose allowance is $6 per day.If we know that 60 students were surveyed, then there are 60 monkeys who are all solicited in y.Therefore, the total allowance would be 360 so Wy + (60 - y)y = 360.After calculating, Green, the student gets: Wy = -6y + 60y = 430.The student wants to know the average of students allowance: 60W/2 = 60 (6y/430)/2 = 60 (2/3) = 180.Thus, the solution is 180/6 = 30.The answer is 30.#

Let x be the $4 average students receive.So, there are (2/3)* x= 45 from the students who get $6.So each $6 average student gets 2*x + 90/2 = 90.If he surveyed 60 students, he surveyed 60 * [7] = 420 dollars from the students who get the $6 allowance.He then surveyed 60 * [8] = 480 dollars from the students who get the $4 allowance.Notice that there is a $4 difference in the 60 * [.] figures.Combining the $0.] figures, we get 420.] + 480 = 920.Now, multiply 920 by days.There are 24 hours in a day so we multiply 920 by 24 hours.We then get 24000 * 920 < Dollars/image> = 199600.The answer is 199600.#

6 * 2 * 3 + 4 * 3 * ( 1 - 2) = 180.question: A herd of 3 owls counted 165 trees and a flock of 4 crows counted 158 trees. How many trees did the whole flock of 6 birds count?answer: Since they are flocking together, each bird counts the same and there is no need to multiply each bird. On the other hand, the flock has twice the amount and therefore we multiply 186 times the amount.The answer is 186.#

Let x be the number of students who got an allowance of $6 and P be the amount paid per student.The average daily allowance is (6x + 4(60 - x)) / 60.Multiplying both sides by 3 x 60 / 2 gives1800 + 1200x = 900x + 2700 x 60 / 2Then plug P = 2700 x 60 / 2 / 60 = 135$ for each student to get 6.305x + 183.32x = 135The answer is x.#

Let M be total amount of money the students get in a day.Our statistics student said that 2/3 of the students get an average of $6 per day  which means 2/3 of 60 students get M/ 3 = 12 students.Therefore, 24 students get an average of $4 per day.M = (24 * 4  ) +  (12 * 6)M = 224 + 12M = 232$So the average amount of money that 60 students get is 232/60 = 4.4$So the answer is 4.4$question:#

The allowance is $5 x 6 + $4 x 2 = 15 + 8 = 23 dollars.The answer is 23.question:#
