 Let X be the number of minutes that she babysat.Notice that $12 = 50 * (X + 20).Then add X to both sides: 12 - 50X = X + 20Since 12 is the only constant on the left side, X = 12 - 20 = - 8. 8 is how much she earns for babysitting, so she earns $12 - 50 * (8 + 20) = -6.The answer is - 6.question: Beth takes 12#

 When working for an hour, Weng earns $12. At 50 minutes though, she earns only 12/50 = $0.24 per minute.She thus earns $0.24 x 50 = 12.8 an hour and as such, the hourly rate is actually $12.8 / 24 = 0.5243 an hour.So, if she works for 50 minutes and then the next hour is consisted of rests, how much did she earn?Would you pay $0.5243 an hour?question: Mary went out to a movie theater at 4:30. The show started at 5:00. The film began 3 minutes late. When the movie started, Mary was 56 seats from the front of the auditorium. How many#

 Let E be how much she earned before tax.So, 130 - E = 40.Using an inequation, we have that E >= 8.8=5 so 8 = 5 - E.So, E = 5 + 1/8 = 6 + 1/12.Let E = x.Therefore, x = 6 + 1/12.The answer is 6 + 1/12 = (6 + 1/2) * 2/3 or 6 + 1/6 + (1/2)/2 * 2/3 = 30 + 8/3 = 19/2 = 9.75The answer is 9.75.question: Yesterday, I made myself a smoothie. Let's say it had 65% more yogurt than fruits.  So it had 40% more yogurt than fruits.  What percentage of smoothie#

 $50 x 30/50 = $30.The same story betwen Weng and Ryan and Ryan $66 and $50 x 66/50 = $30.</s>Introduction
Cognitive Functions, such as memory impairment has been considered the core features of major depressive disorder. Many health-related disabilities have been associated with moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Several studies observed neuropsychological impairment such as memory impairment in patients with chronic physical pain [1] [2] [3]. Depression and pain have bidirectional relationship [4, 5]. Various studies suggest that the pain leads to depression [6] [7] [8] [9]. Others have argued that depression may lead to pain in some individuals [10] [11] [12]#

 Let x be the number of babysitting minutes. Then $12 x 50/100 = $x 100/12 = $x $6So yesterday, Weng earned $6.The answer is $6.question: Thor buys a alphabet puzzle for $10. He then reduces#

 Let x be the amount earned.In other words, x represents the amount earning the $100.5 beside it.x = $100 12 Therefore, $50 12 =.If she did 50 minutes, she earns $50 5 = $50 4 = $200 0 = $200.Thus, the answer is $200.</s>#

 Let s be the amount of babysitting she did.Then 12s = 100 minutes.Divide everything by 100 to get s  12.Turning a fraction into a decimal, 12/100 = 0.12.Divide a decimal by 100 to get a whole number.So s = 0.12 * 0.12 = 0.016Thus Weng earned 0.016 dollars for babysitting for 50 minutes.The answer is $0.016.question: Eric spent $25#

 12 minutes x 12$ = 144$Thus within 50 minutes, the equation will be 144$ + x$ = 50,000$ (time)Subtracting $50,000$ (time) from both sides gives x$ = 144$ + 50,000$ - 144$ = 506$MinutesWeng has 50 days, 25 hours, and 07 minutes to babysit so the answer is 506$ divided by $52 = $15$ dollars per weekThe answer is $15$ dollars per week.question: Toni has joined a karate class. She spends 16 minutes warming up on Tuesdays then 22 minutes warming up on Thursdays. On Wednesdays, she spends only 15 minutes warming up. Each day's warm#

 Let x be the amount money that Weng earns for babysitting.Since Weng did 50 minutes of babysitting, so that is 50 minutes x 12$ = 600$.Weng earned 600 - 50$ = 550$.Therefore, x = 550$.The answer is 550.question: Help Toby with his math homework. He challenged you to solve the system of equations: 2x - y = 30 x + y = 70 x - y =-3To solve this#

 For Weng to be babysitting for 50 minutes she earns (50 * 12) / 60 = 72 cents.So she earns $72 cents for 50 minutes.Therefore, she earns $60 for the an hour.The answer is $60 question, 11: Bob buys 80 vinyl toys for his little sister, Ruby. But 2 of Ricky's toys broke. Just before the trip from Japan, Bob bought 5 new toys in the US. Bob's car got stuck in the#

 Weng earns 12 dollars per hour. So if she babysit for 50 minutes, her pay will be 12 dollars * 50 minutes = $600 dollars.The answer is $600.question: Little Billy shot some targets out of a cannon#

 Let t be the time in hours for babysitting. t hours is 1 hour * t minutes.To solve for t, we need this equation: t= 50 minutes 12 hoursth  = 50/60th = 8 5oth  = 4.5 12xTherefore, the number of hours Weng babysat yesterday was t = 5 hours.There are 12 hours in a day so the number of hours she babysat for today is 5/12 = 0.4333 time a day.Then, Weng wage is 12 * 0.4333 = 5 dollars.question: Bob buys 1.5 kilos of apples for $5.

 Let x be the amount she earns.Then x = 50 minutes.In 1 hour, she earns x = 12∗(x⁄60∗60)/12∗60 minutes.Thus, she earns 150∗(x⁄60∗60)/12 minutes.Therefore, x = 12∗(150∗(x⁄60∗60)/12)∗60 minutes.or x = 12∗30∗(x⁄60∗60)/12∗60 = 15∗30∗x = 15∗30∗(50/60∗60)/12∗60 minutes.The BODMAS rule states that we must treat multiplication and division such as: ×,÷  prior to other arithmetic operations:. Therefore, since ÷ appears before × in this expression, we first treat ÷ by multiplying both sides when solving for x: x = 12∗30∗(50/60∗60)/12∗60 = 15∗30∗(50/60∗60)/(12∗60)∗60 minutes#

 Weng earns $20 a half hour for babysitting.Yesterday she did half of an hour of babysitting (50 minutes) and the other half (50 minutes) will take a half hour.The number of half hours worked would be 2*50 minutes = 100 minutes and there are 100 minutes in a half hour.So, she earned $600 for babysitting for 2 hours.The answer is $600.question: Madeline is making a box of twelve fudge brown#
