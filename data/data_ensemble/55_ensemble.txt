The percentage of flowers that are not roses is 75 - 25 = 50.The answer is 50 percent.#

25 + 40 + 35 = 90.so 90 - 25 = 65. 1.) suppose x= rose. then 65 x 100/90 = 75.2.) suppose x= tulip. then 65 x 100/90 = 85.3.) suppose x= daisy. then 65 x 100/90 = 75.4.) suppose x= neither. then 65 x 100/90 = 75.We also know that  x% of a given percentage is greater than the given percentage.so 75>64%>65>64.5%>64.64%=60%+65%>64.5%This means that 75 isn't the correct percentage of flowers which are not roses.In the diagram above, the given percentage is 65%. Around 15 (15%) of the flowers were neither roses nor tulips or daisies or any other flowers that weren't a tulip or a rose or a daisy.So around 15 (15%) were not roses.However, 15>76%>64%.14!= 135 choose 83choose 83(1254 select 2x3x4x5x6x7#

Let R be the number of roses in the solution set.Now, the total number of roses is R + 25 = Broses and the total number of flowers is the set of Broses + 25 + 40 + 35 = 165.Thus, the percentage of flower not roses is (165 - R)/165 = 165 - 25 - 40 - 25 = 50/50 = 50%.The answer is 50.#

Let the number of flowers that are not roses be represented by natural number n.Let the number of roses be represented by R.Let the number of tulips be represented by T.Let the number of daisies be represented by D.Then we know R + D + T = 25.R + D + T = 25 \approx 42.0875D + R + T = 75 \approx 106.13575We can solve this sum for R, because R = 52.13575/14\approx 39.84525T = 52.0875/14\approx 39.576025Now knowing the total number of flowers in the garden and the number of flowers that are not roses, we can calculate the number of flowers that are not roses. The expression (25 - R)/R = 52.13575/14 = 40.90875 approximately represents the percentage of flowers that are not roses.The answer is 40.90875 / 100 = 40.90875.#

We have 25 roses, so 25 = 25% of flowers are roses.40 tulips and 35 daisies. Thus 40 + 35 = 75 not roses.25 roses = 25%  100  (75 + 50)Therefore 15 = 75 + 50 and 25 roses remains.Thus 75/50 = 15%  75/50 so 25 roses for 15%.The answer is 15%.question:#

34%We know that roses = 25. So, we have 40 x %3 + 35 x %3 + 25 = 100. So, 40 on the left side are 55% of 100. Similarly daisy are 30% of 100 and tulip are 15% of 100. So the answer is 45/100 = 0.#

By definition we have  roses                                             +                                                                              tulips                                                      +                                                                                     daisies TOTAL = 100%.After SPOILER editing.                                                                                                                                                            roses rosas roses roses roses rosas roses roses roses                          5   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0                          5   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 B.Then we haveSPOILER:                                                40 {\displaystyle {\frac {40}{ roses roses rosas rosas rosas rosas#

Roses = 25/13 = 0.179 of the remaining flowers.There are a total of 0.179 x 100% = 17.9% of flowers that are not roses.The answer is 17.9%#

Girls love to solve problems like this one.  Arrange this 12 flowers in a matrix and ask them which row is not roses:Round 1: Roses are Mammoth FlowersRound 2: Roses are called petalsRound 3: Roses are very bigFlowersRound 4: Roses does not have leavesRound 5: Roses is large round flowerRound 6: Roses have a million pollen flakesRound 7: Roses are also called PastelsRound 8: roses in round with sunFlowersRound 9: roses is half a Lark RoundFlowersRound 10: Roses in Round is redNeither tulips nor daisies are red. So those flowers are not roses.Guess letter is backwards because at some point the problem went bad and looked like 51.1243 flowersSince roses represent the most  of the flowers we want to zero each#
