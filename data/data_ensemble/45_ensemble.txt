Let y be the cost of the piñata and z be the cost of the treats.There are 4 bags of Reese's, 3 bags of Snickers, and 5 bags of Skittles.Then we have 4*9 + 3*5 + 5 * 7 = 13 + z.Combining like terms on the left side gives y = 13 + 4 * 9 + 3 * 5 + 5 * 7 = 52 + z.The number of bags of Reese's is 4 and the number of bags of Skittles is 5 so the total number of bags is 9.The number of bags of Snickers is 3 so the total number of bags is 8.Therefore, z = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24.The total cost was 52 + 24 = 76.The answer is 76.question: Buffy is losing her heart in her French class.

We know that the cost of the unicorn is $13 so we can write that as 13 = $13 + x.We know that each bag of Reese's costs $9 and there are 4 bags so 9 x 4 = 36 + x.We know that each bag of Snickers costs $5 so 5 x 3 = 15 + y.We know that each bag of Skittles costs $7 so 7 x 5 = 35 + z.Now, we can solve for x, y, and z.13 = $13 + x36 + x = 9415 + y = 4535 + z = 90There are 4 bags of Reese's so 36 + 4 = 40.There are 3 bags of Snickers so 15 + 3 = 18.There are 5 bags of Skittles so 35 + 5 = 40.The total cost of the treats is: 40 + 18 + 40 = 88.The total cost of the treats and unicorn piñata is: 13 + 88 = 101.The answer is 101.#

We know that the unicorn piñata is worth $13 and the treats are worth a total of $8. Thus, $13 + 8 = 21.We know that there are 9 Reese's, 6 Snickers, and 7 Skittles. So, 4*9 + 3*6 + 5*7 = 84.We know that the cost of one bag of treats is $5 + $7 + 9. And one bag costs 21.$21 = 84/5 = 84/7.The answer is 21.question: Justin has a jar of peanut M&Ms. He put 1 M&M in the jar and ate 18 M&Ms.#

Let x be the cost of the treats. We have x = 13 + 4(9) + 3(5) + 5(7)We can multiply the terms and rearrange this to get x = (13 + 4(9) + 3(5) + 5(7)) - 4(9) + 3(5) - 5(7) = 52 - 20 + 3 - 5 = 18.For the piñata, we have 13 + x = 20. So 13 + 18 = 35.To solve for x, we have 35/13 = 2.5x = 2.5(13) = 26.5Thus the cost of the treats is x = 26.5 cents.The answer is 26.5 cents.#

Let x be the price for the treats.The unicorn piñata cost 13, and x + 13 = the total price of treats.The total price of the treats will be 4x3 + 3x4 + 5x7 = 64.Therefore, x = 64 - 13 = 51.The total cost of treats was 64 - 13 = 51.question: Isaac has earned 256 points in his class#

Let x be the number of bags of Skittles, y the number of bags of Snickers, and z the number of bags of Reese's.Then, the cost of the unicorn piñata is 13 and the cost of the treats is 24.Divide the cost of the treats by the cost of the piñata, so 24/13 = 2 bags of treats.The cost of the treats is then z + 2*(y + z + x) = 24.Add z + y to both sides and z + 2*(y + z + x) + z + y = 24.Then eliminate z and y by subtracting z and y from both sides and z + 2*(y + z + x) - z - y = 24.Subtract 2*(y + z + x) from both sides and z + 2*(y + z + x) - z - y = 24 - 2*(y + z + x).Then subtract 24 from both sides and 24 - 2*(y + z + x) = z - y.But y + z + x = 5 and 2x = 10, so 2x + 2y + z = 10 + 2z.Substitute 2x + 2y + z into the equation and 2x + 2y + z - 10 - 2z = 24 - 2*(y + z + x) - 24.Subtract#

Let x be the cost of the unicorn piñata, and y be the cost of the treats.The equation is 13 + x + y = $53.53 - x = 13 + yTherefore, the equation is y + 13 = 53 - x.Substituting for x gives y + 13 + y = 53.53 + 2y = 53.53 + 3y = 53.Divide by 2, so the equation becomes 53/2 + y = 53.53 + y/2 = 53.53 + y = 110.Divide by 2, so y = 55/2 = 27.Therefore, the total cost was $27 + 13 = $40.The answer is $40.question: There are 2 kids in a box. First, one was pulled out.#

Let's say that x is the cost of the unicorn piñata, y is the cost of the Reese's, z is the cost of the Snickers, and t is the cost of the Skittles.The cost of the unicorn piñata is $13, so x = 13.The bags of Reese's, Snickers, and Skittles cost a total of $29, so y + z + t = 29.We know the cost of each bag, so it must be the cost of the bags of Reese's times the number of bags of Reese's, the cost of the bags of Snickers times the number of bags of Snickers, and the cost of the bags of Skittles times the number of bags of Skittles.We know that the bags cost $29, so the cost of each bag is $29 / 4 + $29 / 3 + $29 / 5 = $4 + $3 + $5 = $12.So y = $12 x 4 = $48, z = $12 x 3 = $36, and t = $12 x 5 = $60.Finally, the total cost is x + y + z + t = $13 + $48 + $36 + $60 = $221.The answer is 221.MUMBAI METRO STUDENT WRITES IN CHILD PROOF SODA CAN#

The unicorn piñata and treats cost: $13 + (9 * 4) + (5 * 3) + (7 * 5) = $68.The answer is $68.question: During the long weekend, Becca and Katie bought 12 different kinds of candy bars and each#

There are 4 Reese's bags and 3 bags of Snickers.Each bag of Reese's is worth $4, and each bag of Snickers is worth $3.These products are all in the same quantity, so we can distribute the coefficient to get $4*3*2*1 = 48.Let's subtract 48 from the piñata, $13 + 48 = $51.This gives the piñata a cost of 51 - 48 = $3. The treats and piñata cost $3 + 48 = $51 altogether.The answer is 51.question: It's at a party. Robin is talking to#
