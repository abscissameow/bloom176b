James has 40 + 10 = 50 years teaching experience.His partner has had 10 - 40 = -10 years teaching experience.The combined teaching years are negative, so we don't know who is teaching more.article wikihowhttps://answers.wikihow.com/Beat-ALL-True-Facts#

They have 30 years of teaching together, given that James has 30 - 10 = 20 years of teaching.Thus, the expression becomes 20 + 30 = 50 years of teaching.The answer is 50 years.question:#

Let x represent the total number years they have taught. So, James has been teaching x + 10 years and his partner has been teaching x + 10.And they have taught for a combined total of 20 years or 2 * 10.Also x + 10 = 2 * 10.This is true for both sides so the equations becomes 2x = 20.The total amount of years they have taught is 10 years.The answer is 10.question:#

10 years = x.So the total number of years they have taught would be 40 + 10 = 50 years.Therefore, the number of years James has been teaching would be 50 - 10 = 40 years.The answer is 40 years.question:#

Let x=1 represent the amount of years that James has taught with y=32 be the amount of years that James' partner has taught.Thus, x+y=40Therefore, x + y = 32 + 1 = 33 which ships to 53 years taught.The answer is 53.question:#

Let y be the combined years of teaching. Then, subtract y from 10 to find the actual years of experience of the other person. Therefore, 10 - y = 20 years.Combining like terms on the left gives 40 - y = 20.Then transfer the y to the right to get 40 = 20 + y.Solve for y produces 80/20 = 4x.Then solve for x gives 4x = 40 years. So the combined years of teaching is y = 40 x 4 = 160 years.The answer is 160 = 160.question:#

So, 40 years - 10 = 30 years.30 years/10 years = 3 times.So, 30 years x 3 = 90 years.The 90 years is the combined experience of both teacher.The answer is 90.question:#

The partner took 10 years to become a teacher.  Therefore, they have taught together for 10 years.James has been teaching for 40 years.  Therefore, they have taught together for 30 years.Hint: 10 x 4 = 40call x the time that James taught.let a be the difference between the time that James taught and the time that his partner taught (a = x - "10 years")x = 40 + a x = 40 + "10 years".Now, distribute the first part of the equation, the 10 to "a". 10*x = 40 ->"1"*4x = 20a"1*4 = 4" for x->4"*a = 4*10"4*a = 4x20"x = 4*a == 10 x = 10 years -> "x" = 10.Integrating this with the first step gives the correct solution.answer: Together they have taught for 10 years.James has been teaching for 30#

Let y be the total number of years taught by the 2 teachers. the 10 years is 10 on Barbara's years and then 40 is James' years. Thus 8y = 60.Therefore, 4y = 30.Thus the teachers teaching together for 30 years. The answer is 30 years.question#

Let X be the combined experience.  So X = 30 + 10 = 40 years. James teaches 20 years. His partner teaches 10 years by 10 less than James teaches. Thus his experience x is 30 - 20 = 10 years.Therefore, the equation is 20 + (10 - 10) = 30 based on experience, he has only 10 more years.The answer is 10.questions verify answers note-experiment with adding/subtraction/rounding/multip#

James has taught for 10 years less than his partner so James has taught for 50 years and his partner has taught for 60 years. 79. ExtendCatherine stole two of five different DVDs; Larry stole all but one of the five DVDs; and Tom stole three of all of the DVDs. How many DVDs did the thieves steal?A) 7B) 5C) 6D) 4answer: We know 3 x 5 DVDs were stolen so 12 DVDs were taken in all.Larry stole all but one of the five DVDs so Larry stole four DVDs and Tom#

Now, x and y are years of experience respectively.So the sum is 10x + (60 - x) = 70.Distributing, 10(x + (60 - x)) = 70.Now, 10x + 60x - x = 70.Taking -x gives 60x - 30x = 70.Arranging the terms gives 2x(50x - 30) = 70.Taking x out of the product gives 2x(50 - 30) = 70.This gives 2y(50 - 30) = 70.By the equation x2 = y2, 50 - 30 = 20. Now y= 20/2 = 10 years. Therefore x = 20 years and y = 10 years therefore their combined experience is 20 years + 10 years = 30years.The answer is 30.question:#

James' experience is 10 years less so it has to be 60 years.James has 30 years of experience. Their combined experience would be 60 + 30 = 90 years.The answer is 90 years.#

Let x be the number of years spent teaching by James.Then, x + 10 - x = 40.Equivalently, x + 30 = 40Simplifying, 40/30 = 1.5.Therefore, x = 30 years.The answer is 30.question:#

So that means that their combined experience is 40 + (10 - 10) = 40 + 0 = 40 years.The answer is 40 years.question:#

Let x be the number of years when James has been teaching.Then the number of years partner spent teaching is 20 + 2x.Therefore, 30 = 20 + 2x.Inverting 20 + 2x produces x = 20 - 10 = 10 years.Thus, the work experience is x + 30 = 40 years.The answer is 40 years.Are you good at math?
