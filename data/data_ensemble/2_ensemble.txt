 Let w = the amount of money Betty needs. Let base = amount she can save for herself. Let parent = amount her parents give her. Let grandparent = amount her grandparents give her.We have w = base + parent + grandparent. But she only has half of what she needs. So, w= base + parent + grandparent / 2.Combining adults using multiplication gives us w=( base + parent)(base + grandparent).Remembering that x = 4x for x $1 bills. Betty needs $206 to buy the wallet.Adding up the bills, and solving for x gives 202 = 2x + 3x + 1.Substituting that value of x into 2x+4x+5 = 202.Solving and simpl#

 Betty has spent half of 10,000 dollars which is 5000 so she needs 5000 more dollars. Her parents are giving her $15 so she only has to spend 8585/2 = 4500moreso we can see that Betty needs 8585 - 4500 = 4,500 more dollars."4,500 is the amount that Betty needs."question: Grandma, your balloons!Grandpa, watch out!Grandma, don't worry.Just give me a minute!Walking is hard for my legs!That's a fat cat!Is Grandma okay?What a foolish bird!Smile!Smiling is my specialty!What's your birth anniversary?What am I like?Iâ€™m so good at English!What time is it?B#

 The cost of the wallet is $100. Let G be the amount given by her grandparents.  Let P be the amount given by her parents and W be the amount she has already. W = G x 2*P/100 + P$$ Also; W + 2*P/100 + P + G = 100So, 2*P/100 + P + G-W = 100We can check that P + G = W (either directly or through cancellation)Now we equate (WR)*2 = W. It follows that R = W/2So, the amount of remaining to be accumulated is (W/2) - W/2 = W/2Final solution, amount needed is W/2 = (100+G)/2 = (100+100/2)/2 = 125 dollars100 + 15 = 125, so 125 - 15 = 110, so money needed is 110 question : Dorffstat is running through a dark forest and encounters a Scooby Doo-like werewolf by the name of Wolfzog.

 Let x be the money Betty is currently short.Then, if her parents give her $15 and her grandparents twice as much, the total money she receives is 2x + 15 = 25.The balance on her savings account would be 25 - x = $50 to begin with.Now the arithmetic mean of x and $50 is (x + 50)/2 = 25.Therefore, Betty begins with exactly $25.The answer is 25.question: A soldier was planning to shoot a ball at a target#

 Let's say that X is the difference between how much money Betty has and how much money she needs.So, $100 - X - (60 + 20) = 0.Then X = 100 + 60 + 2*20 =240 = 2*120.So, Betty as twice as much as her parents and her parents gave her 15 dollars, so she has $(2 + 15)*120 =$220 dollars until she's able to buy her wallet.</s>I.

 Betty has $100 - x = $50 and $15 gives her $60. Betty's grandparents gave her $10 + 2x = $20 so the grandpa's gave $100 - $20 = $80 and the grandma's gave $100 - $10 - 2x = $30.Running the algebra operation gives $10 + 2x - 20 = 30 + 8x.Then, expand the RHS to get $8x = 58$.Finally solve for x and get $x = 30$.The answer is 30.Now, is#

 Let A be the amount of money Betty needed.Therefore, Betty needs $25.Let B be the amount of money her parents gave.Therefore, B = 15.Let C be the amount of money her grandparents gave.Therefore, C = 30.So, Betty only needs $50.The answer is $25.question: Robby and his friends played a game. They each decided to#

Let G be the amount of money Betty gets from her grandparents.Then the equation is (50 + G) / 2 = 100.Distributing 2 to both sides gives (50 + G) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50.Add G to 50 on the right side and get 50 + G = 100.Then combine like terms to get 100 - G = 50.To solve for G, we have 100 - G = 50.To solve for G, we have 50/100 = 0.5, so G = 25.Therefore, Betty needs 25 more dollars to buy the wallet.The answer is 25.question: Danny bought a rain jacket at half the price of the pair#

Let x be the money that Betty already has.So the money that Betty needs is 100 - x.Her parents will give her $15 and her grandparents will give her $30.So the equation is 15 + 2x = 100.Then, distribute 2 to x, so the equation becomes 15 + 2x + 2x = 100.We want to combine the variable on the left side with 15 on the right side, so 2x = 75 and x = 25.15 + 75 + 2x = 100.15 + 75 = 95 and 2x = 5.Therefore, the money that Betty already has is 25 and she needs 75 more to buy the wallet.The answer is 75.#

Let x be the amount of money Betty needs to buy the wallet.We can write the equation 100 = 2x + 15 - 15 + 2x.From here we know that 100 = 2x + 45.Subtract 2x from both sides which gives x = 25.Therefore, the amount of money Betty needs is 25.The answer is 25.question: On Monday J.J. slept 12 more hours#
