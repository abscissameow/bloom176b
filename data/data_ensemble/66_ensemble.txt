A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, then the difference between the balance and the down payment shows Tara's balance after paying for the 4 months.Let B be the balance after 4 months.Thus her outstanding balance will be 20% of the price minus the down payment that she wants to include.Thus her balance will be 80% of 1000.Since she wants the down payment of $20 to be additional, we have 20% of 1000 - $20.Thus her balance after 4 months can be obtained as follows: 1000 * 80% = $800 - $20 = $780.The answer is 780.#

let b be the $20 additional payment.So, the balance becomes b + 64 = 70.Then, compute the payment due in month 1 by 65 * 1 + 64 = $135 so the balance becomes 135 + 70 = 205.Since the balance must equal the initial cost of the laptop, the equation b(0.20)4 + 205 = 1000 must be true.Solving this for b produces b = 1850 or b = 20 such that the extra 20 for the down payment and the $20 for the 4-month payment would be $42.The answer is 42.#

Tara's monthly payment will be $1000/65*4 = $110.And by paying $110, she must still pay $120 so additional $20 is needed.Then the actual amount of cashayounding is $260 so the entire balance becomes 1000 + 260 = 1260.The down payment is 20% of 1260 dollarsso 20% down payment is 1260*20/243 = 3500$so amount of down payment is 3500 dollars.The down payment balance is zero.Thus 500 dollars remain out of 1260.The answer is 500.question:#

Using the formula b = p ( q^n - 1 ) / ( 1 - q ) where q = 0.8, b for 4 months payment is 4*p*(65*40*0.8^-4)/(1-.8^-4) = 3920.Since Tara wants to pay an additional $20 she needs to pay $20 + 3920 = 3960.The answer is 3960.question:#

A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will she pay in total?Since the current balance is $80 now, let's charge the balance to the interest number of installments. This means that $80 + $65*(4) = $1000 + $650*4 = 3500 in total.$350 / 60 (number per month) = $44. $44 + $20 = $64.Given two numbers a and b, and the equation a + b = c. If a c = b, what is a?answer: If c comes when a + b, then c = a + b. So, (c â€“ b) = a#

Let x be the reward on monthly payments(US$65).Tara can make payment by making4x65 + 20 = 1000The reward is 4x4.00 +1000x-20 = 100Tx =2040x-20 = 24-5) * 65-100 = 135/20 = 7x = 27/65 = 4/30 = 12 centsThe best part of Tara's monthly payment is expectation, that is for another 65 cents.question: Laura makes business cards for her pet shop. She uses the computer to type, and doesn't pay attention: When she is done, a type of error occurs for every 100 typed. After corrections, she needs to change all 100 of the same letter, and make another type of error with every 100 letters changed. The number of letters of error was ____ percent of all the letters. (No computer, competes by hand.)   [source:]answer: Let C be the number of letters that Laura changed#

Let y be the amount in balance.Since Tara will pay for 4 months, the amount paid at the end of 4 months is 4*$65=$260$1000 - $260 = $740So the net amount Tara must pay for 4 months is $740 - 20 + 20 = $340.Thus after 4 months, the remaining balance will be 1000 - 340 = 660.The answer is 660.Question-of-the-Week Number of Week: 21 Read More: HomeTop ScoresContact Us.#

Let x be the amount she save each month. So, the total amount spent on the laptop is 1000 + 400(x - 1) = $456.In order to save $520, her amount she will be saving each month is 520/5 to the so the equation becomes x - 1 - 20 = 520So we have connecting the terms on one side of the equation gives 1 + 1/x = 520 x.Then distribute 20 between 1 + 1/x, so we have 20(1 + 1/x) = 520x. Therefore, 20x = 480.Thus, x = 54, so the amount she will be saving each month is 54.Then Tara pays for four months so her balance will be 520 - 27 = 100.The answer is 100.question:#

Let x be the amount of money Tara owes after 4 months.Tara has made a 20% down payment which would be (1 - 0.2) * 1000 = 720, plus 65 for each month is 65 * 4 = 260; and the down payment costs 20 additional dollars which would be (20 + x) * 4 = 80.Subtracting 520+$100 from $1000 will leave Tara without money after four months.The answer is x = 320.question; Sara visited a beach#

Because the amount of money Tara will pay per month will be $65 a month.The number of months Tara plans to pay for this amount is 4 months.These are the variables we consider:x = number of months  Tara plans to pay for the $1000, where,x = 4 and m = $1000 in 4 months.n = $m - 80$1/{1000 + 0.2} = $7004/70 = $304/{1000 + 0.2} = $7/{\left(1000 + 0.2 \right)^{x/4}} = $7/{\left(1000 + 0.2 \times 4 \right)^{x/4}} = $7 \times 8.35 / {500 + 2.4} = $7 \times 10.39 / 503.22Because x = 4, multiply x by 7 and then divided it by 3.14, this and we obtained10.39 4 / 503.22 = 0.2918 Thus Tara will 120.55$ balance in 4 months.The answer is 120.55.question:#
