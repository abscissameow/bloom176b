Let x be the number of teaspoons of salt.Therefore the total number of cups of water, flour, and salt would be 10 * 16 + 16 * 1/2 * x.Simplifying this equation would give x = 16/2.Then, making the total number of cups of water, flour, and salt is 10 * 16 + 16/2 = 46 cups of water, flour, and salt.The answer is 46.question: The length of the scarf that Kelsey bought#

Kimber wants the quantity of water to be 10 cups and the quantity of flour to be 16 cups.And the quantity of salt to be the half of the quantity of flour.So we can write that 10 + 16 + (x/2) = 10 + 16 + 16 x = 60.Squaring both sides, we get 10 + 16 x = 60^2.Square again to get 100 + 160 x = 60^2.For the quantity of flour, we get 100 + 160 x = 60^2.For the quantity of water, we get 10 + 16 x = 60^2.Combining the 60^2 terms, we get (60 + x)^2 = 120.Squaring both sides, we get 360 + 160 x = 120^2.So, we can write that x = 120 - 360 = 240.Therefore, the total number of ingredients needed for making the pizza is 240 cups of flour, 240 cups of water, and 240 teaspoons of salt.The answer is 240.question: One day, while Lance was driving home from school, a tornado passed#

Let x be the number of cups of flour.The number of cups of flour is x/2.Let y be the number of cups of water.The number of cups of water is 2x + 16 - x = 8.Let z be the number of teaspoons of salt.The number of teaspoons of salt is x * z.Therefore, 10x + 8y + (x * z) = x + 2x + 16 - x/2 * z.From the equation, we have z = (x + 16) / 2 + x / 2.The combined total number of cups of water, flour, and salt is 10x + 8y + (x * z) + (16 + x / 2)x / 2 = x / 2 + (x + 16)x / 2 + x / 2.Now solve for x to get x = 8.Therefore, the total number of cups of water, flour, and salt is 10x + 8y + (x * z) + (16 + x / 2)x / 2 = 8x / 2 + 4x / 2 + (4x + 16)x / 2 = 4x + 32x / 2 + 16x / 2 = 8x + 64x / 2 = 4x + 32#

Let x be the total number of cups of water and flour needed.So, 2x = 16 cups of flour.10x + 2x = 30 cups of water.10x + 2x + 1/2x = 30.Thus, x = 4 + 15/2 = 17 cups of water and flour.The answer is 17.question: Raven bought a refrigerator, a TV, and a dvd player#

Let W be the number of cups of water.Let F be the number of cups of flour.Let S be the number of teaspoons of salt.We know that the ratio of salt to flour is 1/2 and we know that F + S = 10.Let W = S / 2.Adding W to both sides gives S + W = F.Thus, the equation becomes F + S + W = 10.Let S = 5 and W = 2, so the equation becomes S + W = F + 2. Then F + S + W = 10 + 2 = 12.Therefore, the number of teaspoons is F + S = 17.The answer is 17.question: In how many ways can you arrange six team members to have each team member be the#

Let W be the number of cups of water, F be the number of cups of flour, and T be the number of teaspoons of salt.Then, the equation is 10x + 16x + 1/2 x (16x) = 88.To solve for x, the expression becomes 1 + 2 = 3 so we solve for x with the equation 16x = 88 - 10 - (1/2 x 16) = 16x = 88 - 10 - (1/2 * 16) - 10 = 88 - 10 - (1/2 * 16) = 88 - 40 = 48.Therefore, the value of x = 48.The solution set is: (W, F, T) = (10, 16, 48).The answer is 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 48 teaspoons of salt.End of problems.That's all for today. Come back tomorrow for#

First, note that since it is given that 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour, she has equal amounts of salt and flour.Let x be the number of cups of salt.Then, there are 16 cups of flour, 16x teaspoons of salt, and 10x cups of water.And it is also given that there is a total of 53 cups of ingredients. 53 = 10x + 16x + 16x so 10x = 53 - 16xNow, plug 16x into one of the 16x cups of flour, so 16x = 8, 16x = 16 and 16x = 32 cups of flour.Now plug 10x cups of water into the 53 total cups of ingredients so 10x = 53 - 16x.Substitute the values of the cups of water and flour into the equation to find 53 - 16x = 10x.Rearrange to get 10x = 53 - 16x - 10x and 16x = 6x.8 = 6x, so x = 5 cups of salt.Kimber has 16 cups of flour, 10 cups of water, and 5 cups of salt.The answer is 5.question: Robert found 3 sticks of different colors (red, blue, and#

The equation is x + (1) + 1/2(x) = 10.We know that x is the total number of cups of flour, water, and salt combined. We also know that x = 10 and 1 + 1/2(10) = 10.Divide each side of the equation by 1/2 so that the equation becomes x + 2 + 1/2 = 10.So we can write the equation x = 9 + 2 + 1/2. Then distribute the number 2 over the fraction 1/2 to get x = 18 + 6 + 1/2.Add all the fractions on the left side to get 27/2 + 6 + 1/2.Then transfer the number 6 to the right side so that the equation becomes 27/2 + 1/2 = 10.Combining like terms on the left side gives 15/2 = 5.Subtract the numbers 15 and 2 so we have 17/2 = 7.Transfer the number 7 to the right side to get 17/2 + 1/2 = 10.Therefore, we have 17/2 = 7 cups, which means that we need 7/7 = 2 cups of water. So, we need 7 + 2 = 9 cups of water.On the left side, there is 16 + 7/2 = 21/2 cups of flour. Therefore, we need 21/2 x 16 = 8 cups of flour.question: How many months is it until Christmas?answer: Let m be the number of months until Christmas#

Combine the units of all the ingredients.The cup is a unit so we want to convert it to a decimal or 100 grams.The cup has 10 liters and 1 liter is 100 grams so 10 liters is equal to 1 kilogram.Therefore, 1 cup = 100 grams.Converting the teaspoon to grams gives 1 teaspoon = 3 grams.This equation produces 10 cups * 16 cups * 1/2 teaspoons = 10 cups * 16 cups * 3 grams = 1000 grams.Since we have cups in the equation we want to convert 1000 grams to cups.The equation is 1000 grams = 1 cup * 100 grams = 100 cups.The number of cups of flour is 16 cups.The number of cups of water is 10 cups.The number of teaspoons of salt is 10 cups.Therefore, the answer is 10 + 16 + 10 = 36 cups.The answer is 36.question: When she was #

Let x be the number of cups of water and y the number of teaspoons of salt.Then the number of cups of flour used is x + 16y = 16y and 1/2 x = y which we write as y = 1/2 x.Thus, x = 16y - y = 16y - 16y + y = 0 - y = -y.But if x is equal to 0, then y has to be 0 as well.So, y must equal 0. Therefore, the number of cups of flour is equal to 0.And x + 16y = 16y = 0 cups of flour.Substituting y = 1/2 x in x + 16y = 0 gives 1/2 x + 16y = 0.Now, divide both sides by 2 to obtain x + 8y = 0.Subtract x from both sides to obtain 8y = 0.Since 8 is not equal to 0, y = 0.Therefore, the number of teaspoons of salt that Kimber used is 16x + y = 0.Teaspoons of salt used in y + y = 0 is equal to y.The answer is y = 0 teaspoons of salt.#
