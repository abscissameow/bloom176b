Let's start by looking at how many days a week Carolyn practices the piano and the violin. Ie: x = number of days practicing the piano; y = number of days practicing the violin. Then, she practiced the piano for 20 minutes a day for 20 x x minutes in a month with 4 weeks. She practiced the violin for 3 x y minutes in a month with 4 weeks. Combining these 2 equations produces 20x + 3x y = 800(20x + 3x y = 80x + 12xy)Now, we want the 20x to the left, and 3x to the right side. Also, we can combine the 20x with the 3x to get 40x on the left and 3x on the right side. Thus the equation is 80x + 12xy = 800 - 40x = 380 - 12xy = 192y = 2 minutes.Now, this gives us a final equation 20x + 2y = 380 and we can solve for x. Solve for x, we have 380/20 = 16.5 x, y = 80. Then we solve for y by taking 20 minutes away from 380 minutes, so we have 380-20x = 20(y + x) = 480 - 2x and we can solve for y, which is 20 - 2(x + 20) = x - 16. We then get y = 44 - 2x and the equation gives us y = 44 - 2x = 60 - 2x = 40 - 2x = 0, thus we find the answer y = 40.question: Julia has spent 2 days practic#

On the piano, she practices for 20 minutes and on the violin, she practices for 30 minutes. 30 / 20 = 1.5 days. Since 30 minutes = 3 hours and 20 minutes = 2 hours, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 3. 2 hours x 1.5 days = 3 hours x 6 days = 18 hours in a month.If Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day and the violin for three times as long. Then on the piano, she practices for 20 minutes and on the violin, she practices for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes = 3 hours and 20 minutes = 2 hours, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 3. 1.5 days x 18 hours = 15.75 days.The answer is 15.75 days.question:#

There are 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in a month.Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day so she practices for 20 x 6 = 120 minutes a week.Carolyn practices the violin for three times as long as the piano so she practices for 120 x 3 = 360 minutes a week.Therefore, Carolyn practices for 120 + 360 = 480 minutes a week.Then there are 120 minutes in a day so there are 480 / 120 = 4 days.4 x 4 = 16 days in 4 weeksSo there are 16 x 4 = 64 days a month.Since there are 120 minutes in a day, Carolyn practices for 480 / 120 = 4 days.The answer is 64.#

Let x be the number of minutes spent practicing.So the number of minutes spent practicing the piano is x and the number of minutes spent practicing the violin is 3*x.Since she practices for 20 minutes a day, 20x = 6*x.In addition, 3*x = 30x.Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 we get 6 = 2x.Thus the number of minutes spent practicing a day is 2x = 6 days a week.So she spent 30 minutes a day practicing. The number of minutes spent practicing a day would be 30x4 = 120 minutes a week.The answer is 120.question: If Francis has 40% more coins than Jane#

Let t be the minutes that Carolyn spends practicing in a month and n is the number of days a week that she practices.Combining like terms yields 20t + 3*(t + 30) = t(4*30) + 6*20.From here, cancel t and n to get 6 + 12 = 18.Divide both sides by 6 and solve for t which gives 3t = 18/6 = 3 and the final answer is 18t = 90 minutes.The answer#

Let x be the number of minutes of practice a day.Then she spends (6 * x) minutes per week.For a month, there are (4 * 7) days so she spends (12 * x) minutes a month.To solve for x, divide 12 by 20 to get (6 / 5) x = 60 / 20.The answer is 60 / 20 = 3 hours.The answer is 3 hours.question: Fired from his job, Pedro cuts his expenses#

Let x be the number of minutes that Carolyn practices the piano.The violin part can be modeled as 3x because it is three times as long as the piano part.So the time spent practicing piano and violin each week is 20 + 12x = 22x.Now the piano and violin are practiced every week so 22x = 6.Therefore, the number of minutes practiced in a month would be x = 120 min.The answer is 120.question: Isabel has#

Let A be the number of minutes Carolyn practices in a month.Carolyn spends 20 minutes practicing the piano and 3 x 20 = 60 minutes practicing the violin.So she spends 3 x 20 = 60 minutes x 6 days a week = 120 minutes practicing a week.So she practices 120 minutes x 4 weeks a month = 480 minutes a month.Therefore, the number of minutes Carolyn practices in a month is 480 minutes.The answer is 480 minutes.question#

Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day, so she practices (6 days * 20 minutes) = 120 minutes a week.If she practices six days a week, she will practice 720 minutes (or 12 hours) in a month with four weeks.The answer is 12 hours.question:#

Carolyn practiced for 20 minutes for 6 days a week. She practiced for 20 x 6 = 120 minutes in a week.She practiced for (120 รท 4) x 4 = 60 minutes in a month.The answer is 60 minutes.question: Henry went to the store and bought#
