Let x be the amount of money spent by Mike on the shirt.Then, Mike will have 2500 + 200 = 2500 + x dollars.Also, Johnson will have 2500 + 200 + x = 5000n Thus, we have 2500 + x = 5000/2.Distribute the 2 to the 5000, so we get 2500 + 5x = 5000.The left side of the equation is 2500 + 5x, which simplifies to 5500.Then, we have 5500/2 = 3000.Simplifying gives x = 1000 dollars.The amount of money spent on the shirt by Mike was 1000 dollars. Mike has 3000 dollars remaining.The answer is 3000.question: Lorena bought a new shirt for $#

Johnson got 2500 x 2/5 = $1250.And Mike has $1250 - 200 = $1250.Mike's remaining money is 1250/1250 = $1.His shirt cost $200 so there is $1 - 200 = -$199 left.The answer is $199.question:#

Let x represent the amount of money Mike has. Johnson has x * 2/5 of the profit so his share of the profit is x * 2/5. Mike has 3/5 of the profit so his share of the profit is x + x * 3/5 = x + x * 4/5.However, Johnson is worth $2500 so 2x * 2/5 + x * 4/5 = 2500. Then, distribute 2/5 to both sides. So 2x + 4x * 2/5 = 2500.The first equation, with x, is 4x = 2500. This is the same equation as 2x+x = 2500.x = 2500 - 4 = 2475.Mike spent $200 on a shirt so his share of the profit after spending on the shirt is $2475 - 200 = 2475 - 200 = 2475 - 200 = 2400. The amount Mike has after spending money on the shirt is $2400.The answer is $2400.question: Carla runs 18 kilometers every day except Saturday and#

Let x be the number of dollars that Mike spent.So, 2500x is Johnson's share, and then after that, Mike has 500x dollars to spend on a shirt.So after spending the x dollars on a shirt, Mike has 2x dollars to spend on something else.Thus, the equation is 250x = 500x + 2x.Dividing both sides of the equation by 25 and then multiplying both sides by 10 gives x = 10.Thus, the number of dollars that Mike spent on a shirt was 10 dollars.Therefore, after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200, Mike has remaining 500 - 200 = 300 dollars.The answer is 300.#

Let x be the amount of money Mike spent on a shirt and y be the amount of money Mike received for his share in the profit.Then Johnson received 5x = 2500, Mike received 2x + y = 2500.Using the given information about the proportion, we have the equation x = 5y/2.Then x = 5/2 * y. Now distribute the 1/2 to the both sides of the equation. So we have x = 5 * y / 2.Divide both sides by 5. So the equation becomes x = y/2.So x = y/2 = $1000.The amount of money that Mike has is 1000 + 200 = $ 1200.The answer is $ 1200.question#

Let x be the amount spent by Mike.Then x/5 of his profit goes to purchase the shirt and he receives only 2/5 x = 1000. Johnson gets 2/5 (2000 + x) = 1000 + x.Using the given information about the proportion, we have the equation x = 1000 / 5 = 200.Therefore, Mike paid 200 to purchase the shirt.The answer is 200.question#

Let x be the number of dollars Mike has. He has x * 5 = $500 after his business transaction. He spends $200 on a shirt, so he has $200 + x * 5 = $800. Thus, x = $800 / 5 = $160.Therefore, Mike has $160 dollars.The answer is $160.question: On a map of 20 acres, trees are dotted. The circle representing a tree is 2 inches in diameter. How many trees are#

Johnson's share is 5000*20/(2*5) = 2000 so Mike's share is 2000-200 = 1800.Since Johnson spent his share of the profit, Mike will have the whole profit (which is 1800) since they are 2 partners.The answer is 1800.question: The daily temperature#

Let x represent the amount that Mike spent for the shirt. Then we have$2500 + 200 - x / 5 = 2(x)Since 200 is divided by 5, it is left as a constant. Next, 25 is divided by 2 to get 10, which is then subtracted from 2(x). So we have 2(x) - 10 = 2(x) - 10 = x + (x - 10) = 2x - 10.Thus, the number of dollars that Mike spent on the shirt is $200.So Mike will have$2500 + 200 = x + (x - 10) = 2x - 10 - x = $x = $2000The answer is $2000.question: Grant needs $200 to repair the broken radio in his car. He has no cash#

Let y be the amount of money spent on the shirt by Mike.Then the profit is $2,500 - y and the total amount is $2,500 + 2y.Multiplying the same thing by 2y gives (2y)(2y) = 4y^2 + 5y.Rearranging to solve for y gives y = sqrt(2953/5).Divide the whole equation by 2y to get y^2 = 1728/5 + y.Then, take the square root of both sides so y^2 = sqrt(1728/5) + y.Solve for y to get y = sqrt(9/4).Rearrange the equation to get 4y^2 + 5y = sqrt(9/4).Then, square both sides of the equation and add the two equations together, so 4y^2 + 4y^2 = 9 + sqrt(9/4).Adding the y^2's on both sides of the equation gives y^2 = 11.Solve for y by using y^2 = 11 and solve to get y = 3.Therefore, Mike spent 3 on the shirt.The answer is 3000.question: Keagan was curious about the probability that a card#
