The number of hours he worked is (20) hours.His original day wage is 8*80$ / hour is 80 divided by 8 approx.$10 / hour.Bonus 20$/hr is paid in addition to base pay, so his bonus is 10$ + 20$ = $30/$hr.Question 4Sometimes we don't need to calculate each part separately. Instead we can use algebra to make calculations faster.See graph:-  watching  for minutes

His day is 8 hours long.  If he decides to work for the bonus he will work 10 hours. He needed a significant amount of work at a slower rate for his bonus, about 17.6 hours.  This means that if he makes $80 per day, he will make a total of 10*80 - 17.6*30 = $1320 per day.  If we divide this number by the number of hours of work he makes a bonus, which in this case is 10, he gets $20 per hour. The answer is $20.question:#

If he decides to earn the bonus, then he works for 10 hours a day instead of 8 hours.So the equation is 80 * 10 + 20 * 30 = $1400.Question source:thinkquest.page 77 answer#82answer#82:“Attack the enemy!

Each quarter one student would be recognized in the College#

Suppose he works from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.normal pay = 8 000 dollar,bonus = 20 000,additional hours = 6 hoursSo total hours = 12 maybe he can take a break after six hourso hishours = 8 + 6 = 1480 hours of complete week8 6 means ABC ABCAB and on last day of week is Sundayso is also a working day8 hours each day.Before bonus he earned 8000$ per week is = 5600After bonus he earn is:normal pay + bonus = 8000 + 20000 = 24000 Add hoursissay he has made 8000/day( 40hours)So for figure it out we divide 24000 with 7.25( 8 hours per day)24000 twenty four thousand sum up to one week = 7 days per week7.25 looks like 25hours per day24000 / 7 is (5600 + 8000) / 7.25(5600 + 8000)(4380 + 7200) / 7.25 (or 5600 / 7.258000 / 7.25) * 0.25#

$80 + $20 * 8/8 = $80 + $16 = $96 / 8 = $13 / hour$13 / hour = $13 / 45 minutes = $0.28 / 1/4 an hourTherefore, he makes $0.28 per 1/4 hour.The answer is $0.28.question#

Given the statement "extra effort," the assumption is made that it takes more work to make up that $20.  Since an extra $20 means that John would make $160 per day for a 200% increase, this means that the normal expected income before the bonus is $20 per hour.This approach, however, requires working a longer workday.  It will take him 10 hours next to 12 hours (the first number multiplied by 8 and the second number multiplied by 100) to make up everything. The 10% bonus is rounded down to 14.29%.This is 136.43% of the time, which is the closest larger multiple than 50%, making the percentage of the extra hours x.Given, though, that he has been offered the $20 a day, he can give up this bonus for the lowered#

Express amount per 8-hour shift as 2 + x.Let B is the bonus that he earns. 20x + 200 = 80.Distribute 20x + 200 and add $2 so that it becomes a pair of linear equations, 2x + 10 = 80 2x + 20 = 40x + 10 = 80 2x + 20 = 50x + 20 = 40Subtract 2x from (2x + 20) and B and (10) respectively so that it becomes x + 20 = 20x + 5 = 40Substitute 2x = 20x + 5 into the final equation.Now solve for x. x = (5 ÷ 2)^2.So, he makes 20 ÷ 10 = 2.2 per hour. The answer is $20 ÷ 10 = 2 and $50 ÷ 40 = $1.25.#

Let x be John's pay per hour and d be the bonus amount. Then we have 80x = 80 * 8 = 640, and 20x = 20 * 8 = 160.The bonus payment is then 6x = 160 - 640 = 320.Thus, x = 320 / 6 = 50 dollars per hour.The answer is 50.question:#

$80 + $20 * 4 = $160$8 * $160 $/workday = $1280$160 / $1280 = $0.133$$133/$1280 * 130/work hour = $.136 per work hourThe answer is $.136$/$work#

To find out how much John makes per hour, we need to find out what his total earnings per day are. Then we need to calculate his average earnings per hour. To do that we know that John makes $80 a day and he works for 8 hours. So $80 x 8 = $640, which is the total earnings from his 8-hour workday. Let x represent his total hours of work. $640 / x = how much John makes every hour.To solve for x, we need to find out the value of x when $7.20 is equal to 0.64. So using the equation 7.20 = 0.64, we can find out x. So we have x = 165. Now x represents the number of hours John works. So, he earns $640 every 8 hours. If transitioned, John earns $640 / 165, which equals $39.02 per hour.The answer is $39.02.question:#
