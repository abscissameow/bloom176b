 Let the fabric left be A.Then the size of the living room is 16/4 = 4 squares by 12/6 = 2 squares.Multiplying the two sides of the living room by A gives 2A * 2 = 16 and 2A * 4 = 12.Simplifying, A = (16 + 12)/2 = 10.Similarly, the size of the bedroom is 16/2 = 8 squares by 12/4 = 3 squares.So, multiplying the two sides of the bedroom by A gives 3A * 2 = 8 and 3A * 4 = 12.So, A = (8 + 12)/2 = 12.Therefore, 12 square feet of fabric was left.The answer is 12.question: Alex#

Let r be the number of 4 by 6 rectangles. The area of the 4 by 6 rectangle is 4 * 6 = 24 square feet.The 4 by 6 rectangle represents 2 rectangles of the 16 by 12 rectangle. So the 16 by 12 rectangle is represented by 2 * r = 2 * (4 * 6) = 16 * 12 = 192 square feet.There are 192 square feet - 48 square feet = 144 square feet of fabric leftover. The number of 2 by 4 rectangle is 2 * (4 * 6) / 12 = 6 * 3 = 18.Therefore, the leftover amount in square feet is (144 * 18) / 192 = 13 square feet.The answer is 13.#

Let F be the number of square feet of fabric left.Then the equation is 2F + F = 16 * 12.Then separate by 2 and F + 8 = 16 * 12.The 8 is the unknown, so we have 8 = F * 8/12 = F * 4.The answer is F = 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.Question: In the above problem, instead of using#

 Let x be the amount of fabric left in square feet.So the fabric needed for the living room is 4 * 6 = 24 square feet.Similarly, the fabric needed for the bedroom is 2 * 4 = 8 square feet.Thus the expression is 16 * 12 - 24 - 8 = 0.Then substitute in 16 * 12 for x.Thus we get 0 = 16 * 12 - 24 - 8.Then distribute 24 + 8 across the parenthesis.Therefore, 24 + 8 / 12 = 9 / 12.Simplifying the expression, it becomes 6 / 12.Then the amount of fabric left in square feet is 6 / 12 * 12 = 0 square feet.The answer is 0.#

Let x represent the square feet of fabric that Ann would use in the living room, and y the square feet she would use in the bedroom.First, the total amount of fabric used would be 16x + 12y, but there is a 16x rectangle and a 12y rectangle so 16x + 12y = 16 * 12 = 192 feet.From this equation, it can be seen that 12 * y = 192. Dividing both sides by 12 gives y = 16.The number of square feet of fabric used in the living room would be 4x * 6 = 48. To find the number of square feet of fabric used in the bedroom, Ann needed to subtract the amount of fabric used in the living room, or 48 - 4 = 44 square feet of fabric.The answer is 4 * 48 = 192.question: If a car has a distance of 12 miles to travel on#

Lets call the first rectangle ABCD and the second rectangle EFGH.So ABCD = 4ft x 6ftEFGH = 2ft x 4ftBy the Area of a rectangle formula, ABCD = 4 x 6 = 24 feet^2EFGH = 2 x 4 = 8 feet^2The remaining piece is 16 x 12 - 24 - 8 = 8 feet^2Because the fabric is 16ft x 12ft, the answer is 16ft x 12ft - 8ft x 8ft = 32ft^2.The answer is 32.question: Every morning, Carla puts 79 apples in her#

Let A be the amount of fabric left in square feet. So 16 x 12 = 192 square feet.The amount of fabric in the living room is 4 x 6 = 24.And the amount of fabric in the bedroom is 2 x 4 = 8.Now subtract 16 - 24 - 8 to get A = 140.So A = 140/160 = 0.875.The answer is 0.875.The answer is 9.75.#

The total amount of fabric that is not cut for curtains would be 16x12.If the square feet left is x, then the curtains would be 12 - 2x.We subtract 6x from both sides of the equation to get 6x = 12 - 2x.From here, we can easily solve for x to get x = 3.The answer is 3.question: Rob and Lisa#

Let B be the number of apples that Buffy stole. Then 79 - B - 26 = 8.Combining constants produces 53 - B = 8.Adding B to both sides produces 52 = B + 8Thus the number of apples stolen by Buffy is B = 53 - 8 = 45.The answer is 45.question: Ann is cutting fabric to make curtains. She cuts a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for the living room, and a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for the bedroom. If the bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, how much fabric is left in square feet?answer: Let x be the number of feet that Ann cuts the living room curtains.Then the area of the living room curtains would be x * x * 3. The floor area of the bedroom curtains would be 2x * 2x * 3.She cut x inches from each side of the 4 by 6 rectangle so it is 4 * x * 6 * 3 inches.Then, she cut the 2#

 Let x be the number of square feet that Ann used for the bedroom curtains.So, for the living room curtains, the rectangle area was 4x * 6 = 24 feet * 12 feet = 288 feet2.Subtracting the living room area from the total area gives 48 x (16 x 12) - 288 = 48(144 - 144) - 288 = 48 - (288 - 288) = 48 - 0 = 48.Thus, Ann used x = 48 square feet for the bedroom curtains.The remaining fabric for the bedroom curtains is 48 - 48 = 0.Now that we have a final answer for x, we can solve for y.y = 2x * 4 * 2 = 16 square feet.Thus, the final answer is 16 square feet.The answer is#
