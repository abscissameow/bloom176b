Let x be the number of slices Albert eats.Then x + x + 2x = 2 * 16 = 32.And 32 + 2x = 32 + 8 * 2 = 48.Since 48 + x = 64, then 64 = 4 * x.Therefore, the number of slices Albert eats is 4x = 16.The answer is 16.question: Ryan bought 72 crayons for $10, 36 markers for $6, and 20 pencils for $4. If Ryan spent more than half his money#

Since the large pizza has 16 slices, and each pizza has 8 slices, Albert eats 1 large pizza, 1 small pizza, 2 large pizza slices, and 2 small pizza slices. Since Albert eats all of the pizzas, he must have eaten 4 slices each of 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. Therefore, he eats 16 + 16 = 32 slices.Large pizza 16 small pizza 8 answer is 32.The answer is 32.#

 He will have (2*16 + 2*8) = 32 slices of pizza.The number of slices he ate is: 32 ÷ 2 = 16 slices.16 ÷ 2 = 8 pieces.He ate 8 pieces of pizza.The answer is 8.question: How many times would you have to cut a#

Let L and S be the number of slices of large and small pizza, respectively.Each large pizza has 16 slices, and each small pizza has 8 slices.Combining all slices, we have 2L + 2S = 32.Solving for S, we have S = 32 - 2L = 24.Each large pizza has 16 slices, and each small pizza has 8 slices. A small pizza has 8 slices, so each small pizza has 8 slices. Therefore, each large pizza has 16 slices, so each large pizza has 16 slices.So each large pizza has 16 slices.Therefore, he eats 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices, so he eats 16 slices on each large pizza.Then, he eats 16 + 8 = 24 slices.The answer is 24.question: Joe has 120 pennies and I have 76 pennies.#

 Let x be the number of slices Albert eats on a small pizza. Let y be the number of slices Albert eats on a large pizza.Then 2*x + y = 16 + 8 = 24 slices.Then 24 = 2*x + 2y + 12x + 12y.We can combine the 12 into 2*x + 2*y so the equation becomes 2(x + y) = 24.Then distribute 2 to x + y so the equation becomes 2x + 2y = 24.Then we can combine the x + y into one, so it becomes 2(x + y) = 24.Then 2x = 24 - 2y.And we can solve for y, so y = 24 - 2x.Therefore, y = 24 - 2x = 16 - 2(2x) = 12 - 4x.Solving for x, we have 4x = 12.Therefore, x = 24 - 2(24 - 12) = 12 - 2(12 - 4) = 12 - 20.Therefore, the number of slices Albert eats on a small pizza is 12.The answer is 12.Question: Harry was sent from the house at about 1:30 in the morning. If he left#

et x be the number of pieces.2 x large pizzas has 32 pieces.The small pizzas also has 32 pieces. Thus, 2 * 32 = 64 pieces.Adding the large and small pizzas gives 64 + 64 = 128 pieces.128 divided by 16 gives 8.128 divided by 8 gives 16.Therefore, the number of slices is x = 16.The answer is 16 slices.question:#

 Let P be the number of pieces of pizza eaten by Albert.Then the number of slices on large pizzas is 2*16 = 32 slices.The number of slices on the small pizzas is 2*8 = 16 slices.Since he ate 16 + 32 = 48 slices.He ate 48 pieces of pizza in total.The answer is 48.question: Yolanda goes to the store with a grocery list.#

Let L be the number of large pizzas, and S be the number of small pizzas.Thus, we have 4 pizzas total and 2L + 2S = 16 + 8 = 24 slices.Therefore, 2L + 2S = 24, or L = 24 / 2 = 12.Now, we know the number of large pizzas (L) is 12.As for the number of small pizzas, we have S = 16 - 12 = 4.The answer is 12 large pizzas and 4 small pizzas, or 16 total slices.The answer is 16 slices.answer: Once again, Let L be#

Let L be the number of large pizzas he eats.Let S be the number of small pizzas he eats.Then the number of slices he eats is L * 16 + S * 8.Then he eats all of them and each pizza has 8 slices, so the total number of slices is L * 16 + S * 8 = 100.By combining like terms, we get L * 10 + S = 100.Now, divide both sides by 10.L + S = 100/10 = 10.Simplifying the equation, we get L + S = 2.L + S = 10 = 2 + 6 so L = 2, and S = 6.The answer is 26 slices.question: April learned her sister Rebecca has 3, 4, and 6 younger siblings. Can#

Let x be the number of slices.The number of pieces he eats is 16 + 2x = 18 + 2x.The expression simplifies to 17 + 2x = 18 + 2x.Then, distribute 2 to both sides to get 17 + x = 18 + x.Then, add 2 to both sides to get 19 + x = 18 + x.Solving for x produces x = 1 piece.Thus the number of slices = 16 + 2x = 16 + 2 x = 18 + 2 x = 19 + x = 1 piece.The answer is 1 piece. question:“Three nines are#
