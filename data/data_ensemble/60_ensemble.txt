Let N be the total number of hours.Then 8(2N) + 16(4N/4) = 40*N.Equating the coefficients on both sides gives 2N2 + N = 40.Substituting back we simply get N = 20.The answer is 20.question: As you pack your suitcase for a 3-day trip, you are packing shoes, shirts, pairs of underwear, shaving kits and books. Imagine your suitcase has 6 pockets. You put 4 pairs of underwear in each of 2 pockets and 1 book and 1 shaving kit in each of the remaining pockets. Your suitcase has more shaving kits than shirts. What is the number of shaving kits?answer: Let x and y denote the number of pairs of underwear and shavers respectively#

Let y equal the total hours spent.Then y is the same everywhere so it becomes 4x + 4*y is the total number of hours gameplay is being doubled so it equals 4x + 8y. Now 4x + 8y = 16x + 8y.Subtracting the x's gives y + y = 16y.Multiplying by 4 gets 4y = 64.Transferring 64 to the right-hand side gets y = 64/4 = 16 hours.That’s total of 16 hours that Jerry spends watching his daughters play and practice all in all.answer:  Let x represent the total number of minutes Bernadette spends rehearsing with the choir#

Each game last 2 hours so Jerry will be watching B = 8 games for B = 16 hours.Each team practices 4 hours so Jerry will be watching 8 games of 4 hours each for A = 32 hours.Therefore, the total hours watched by Jerry will be 16 + 32 = 48 hours.The answer is 48.question: Vesper spent 6 hours at a record store. She paid for 6 CDs while there. When she left 5 CDs were played on an old floor-standing CD player, while the other was played on her portable CD player. After leaving the record store, Vesper got a flat on her car. These circumstances imply that Vesper rented 4 hours of drive time to get home before her flat tire was fixed. What is the time of CDs that Vesper played on her noon portable#

Each girl has 8 * 4 = 32 practices and 4 * 4 = 16 games. Thus Jerry is going to spend (32 + 16) = 48 hours on his daughters. The answer is 48.question: Tom and Roger are going on a camping trip. They bought two tents, two sleeping bags, a table, two chairs and a portable light. The table cost the same amount as their light. They paid for all the other items with cash. What is the smallest amount Tom and Roger spent that way?Answer: Let x be the amount spent on using cash#

Let x be the number of hours spent by Jerry at the field watching his daughters play and practice.Then, if there are 8 total games the girls played, 4*8 = 32 hours.So the expression is x + 32.Combine the constants, leaving only x.Transfer 32 to the right side to give the answer x = 64.The answer is 64 hours.question: Mike had some extra sets of shelves. Two days ago, his friend was moving away and asked him to borrow 12 sets of shelves. He lent 12 sets of shelves to his friend. The next day his sister asked for some of the same shelves that his friend has borrowed. Mike gave 7 extra sets to his sister. So now Mike no longer has any extra sets of shelves. How many sets did he originally have#

Team A plays a total of 8 games and practices 48 hours. 8 games / 2 (hours) = 4 (hours). Team B plays a total of 8 games and practices 48 hours. 8 games/ 2 (hours) = 4 (hours) 48 hours = 24 (hours).Therefore, the total hours for Team A is 24 + C and Team B is 24 + C.The answer is 28. Make sense?Feel free to check out ESpring Answer Key if you encountered difficulty on any of the questione#

Each game lasts for 2 hours so the total number of hours for playing a game for both girls is 2x.As they have 8 games they would have 4x for the games.Applying the Condition, 4(x) + 2x = 20As Jerry and his daughters watch their daughters play and practice at the park for 20 hours.The answer is 20.question:#

Let A represent the number of hours the team plays. Also, let B represent the number of hours the team practices for their games.The break down is 8 games = 2 practices + 6 games. Looking at the team’s practice and game schedule: 2 hours - 4 hours = -2 hours. -2 times 6 = -12. Adding both equations: 2 + 6 = 12.Thus, 8 games = 2 hours + 12 = 4 hours.Then, dividing both sides by 8 games, 1 game = 3/4 hours.Therefore, 2 games = 2 3/4 = 6 3/4 = 3 3/4 hours = 23/4 hours.Set A is 3 1/4 hours.Set B is two 23/4 hours.Therefore, the answer is 25.question:#

Let G be the number of games and W be the number of hours of practice.So, Jerry doubles his workout, meaning that his practice hours is double the number of typcial games.If his daughters have 8 total games each, and they practice for 4 X 8 = 32 hours, then leading to the expressions of 4(8) + 4(32) = 64 games.Adding the amount of game time to the practice time cancels out the practice time, so we may end with 64 again.Therefore, his total time spent is 32 + 8 = 40 hours. The answer is 40.#

Let x be the number of hours spent at the field at a particular day. Jerry practices with all of his daughters on 4 days a week.Therefore, at each of those 4 days Jerry spents 4 * x hours.4 * x is a constant (let it be a) and it is 8 times a.Also, a times 2 is the number of minutes in a game.Therefore, (8 * 2 * a) weeks are required for a team to get 8 games, but they practice on 4 days for a total of 16 games. The equation is 4 × x = 8 × a × 2 × 16 = 208.16 is 2^2, so 16 is 8 times a simple 2.The equation is simplified to 4x = 8a.8 is listed as the left side of the equation. Let the left side of the equation be 8+8, so 72 + 8 = 80 + 4.8 + 8 is 16. Multiply both sides by 4 and distribute the, so 16#
