Let H(x) be the height of the aquarium in cubic feet.These are the steps that Nancy takes thus creating over a thousand different equations:  
((1/2) x H(x)/2) - H(x)/2 + 4

By all means, this means H(x) = (1/2)x.During these changes, the aquarium is still halfway full.(H(x)/2) before - H(x)/2 afterwards + 4 initially = H(x) once again.We have H(x)/4 before - (H(x)/2)/2 = afterHas Nancy tripled the water in the aquarium? 3H(x) = H(x) + 2x

Therefore, we will have 4H(x) = (1/2)x + 2xHas the service finished? 2x + H(x) = 2H(x)/2 - H(x)/2 + 4

Combining them gives the latest version of: H(x) = (1/2)x + 2x + 4.Starting with the x-value that Nancy has told. (x + 2 x + 4)/4 = 4

After he/she turns the aquarium back up to its original height.But now the remaining four cookies are#

To start we know that Luca (the cat) had knocked it over and 2 thirds of the contents spilled out so the height now is just 1 third of the original height + the contents of the Aquarium. Then we use the dimensions of height to find the volume of water in the Aquarium. Let's draw the diagram showing the height of 1 third from the original height of the Aquarium. This allows us to see the new base of the Aquarium which will be 3 ft. L x 6 ft. W and that gives us 18 square ft. of new stock. We will set the new water level at the top dotted line. Then we solve the problem.3 ft. high1/3 of the 4 feet high before the spill1 ft. high after the spillTherefore, 2/3 of 4 ft. high x 6 ft. wide x 3 ft. high1/3 of the watertotal#

Let L be the length in feet, W be the width in feet, and H be the height in feet.First the volume of the aquarium before the water was ruined is 2LWH.Then the volume of the aquarium after twice doubling the water is 2(2LWH).Thus, the volume after the evaporation is 2LWH.The initial amount of water is bounded to be 4*6*3 = 864.Therefore, the final volume is 1000 - 384 = 576 cubic feet.The answer is 576.question:#

1/2 X and the volume of water that will fall out of the hole after the cat knocked the aquarium down is 2 + 1/2 = 2 1/2 X.Therefore, total volume is 1/2 X + 2 1/2 X.Because the height does not change, then the width doubles up, also the length is doubled up.So 2x equals the length, 2x equals the width, and 2x equals the heights.X = 2(2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2).Don't forget the negative sign.X = 2 x (-4x2) = -16x2.After normalizing.V = 2 x (-4x x -4).Now that we have the volume, don't forget the negative sign on the front of the equation.Combining the terms on the left side.This becomes 2x-4x2 = 12x2.It's 1/2 of the original quadruple of factors.So, Do the double-negative distribution, which is 2 of 12.So, it's 4 of 16.Divide through#

Let W3 be the volume of water in the aquarium after Nancy comes back and triples the water level. Then The volume before the cat knocks the aquarium over is the half of this volume, or W3/2.Let W2 be the total volume of water in the aquarium. Then W3 = (3W2) + W2/2.From the initial problem, we have (3W2) = W2/2, or 3W2 = W2.Generally speaking, the equation 3W2 = W2 is a same-volume proportional equation.Now we just need the relationship between W2 and W3.Since the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, volume in the aquarium is 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = 72 feet.Then 72 ft3 = W2, so W2 = 180 ft3.Then W3 = 180 ft3 / 2 = 90 ft3.After multiplying the equation above by 3, 90ft3 / 3 = 30ft3, so the answer is 30#

Let u be the number of cubic feet of water in the aquarium when it is half full.So, before the aquarium is knocked over, there will be 3 * u cubic feet water in it.Now after being knocked over and refilled, the aquarium will take 3*u x 1/2 cubic feet = u cubic feet to be full again.So, after the accident, it takes u cubic feet so fill the aquarium.The volume of the aquarium is 4 x 6 x 3 = 72 cubic feet.So the graph will hold (3/4)x72 cubic feet.After the cat knocks the aquarium over, less than half of the water is spilled.One fourth of 72 cubic feet will be less than half of the original water.Thus, the number of cubic feet remaining in the aquarium will be 72 - 3/4 x 72 =0.25 x 72 = 27 cubic feet.The answer is 27 cubic feet.question:#

L: length W: width H: heightTo keep the units: L = 6feet, W = 4feet, and H = 3feetTherefore, by substituting,6x6x4x3 x(x + 1) = 12288Write 12288 = i + j and rearrange to get 2x10x5 = 80jHence, 2x = 5i - 5j and 3 = 5kThen, 6x = Li + 2h and 4 = WLj + hTo get rid of x, write h = Li + aLb -> h = 3a + b2a = 6 -> b = 4 -> h = 12If we scale the length by 3, this gives 6144x = 12(6144) and the area will be 6144 square feetThis is 4272.75, so she fills a 45-gallon aquarium with 75 gallons. The answer is 6144.75?ALWAYS HAVE A 3% DOWN PAYMENT#

Let w = number of cubic feet of water.  The length, width, and height of the aquarium are, 4, 6, and 3 respectively.   Fractional amount 1/2 height = 3/2When Nancy came back, the height was 3 x 3/3 = 3, and 3 x 4/4 = 3.    Fractional height is 3/2 x 3/3 = 3 x 3/2 thus the new height is 7/2   x, y, and z = length, width, and height, respectivelyWhen the aquarium was spilled over, w = 3/2 x (x + y + z)By the Law of Exponents for Multiplication, when the appx is raised to spot n in this case 7/2, the result is the intermediate value (sum) of the amount raised to n raised to the nth power. Thus, w = 2x/4 + 2y/6 + 2z/27.    taking the fraction of w to cancel the intermediate value of 2 leaves 6/7Decimal interpretation of#

The dimensions of the aquarium are 6 x 4 x 3 = 48 feet of water.A theorem states that 48/3 = 16 feet.Since Nancy went to answer the door and while did so her cat knocked the aquarium over, Nancy had filled the aquarium up to half = 48/2 x 3 = 12.Now since the cat knocked over the aquarium while it tried eating 12 x 3#

Let F be the number of cubic feet of water. The expression "3 * (4 * 6 * 3) / 2" tells us that we have 3 times as much water now.  So F = 3 * (4 * 6 * 3) / 2.We can start by telling you that F has to divide by 8 feet.  There are 3 times as much now (why?) so we reformulate it as F ÷ 8 = 3 * (4 * 6 * 3) ÷ 2.Then we separate the cube root, so we have (3 * (4 * 6 * 3)) ÷ (8 ÷ 2).Now the parentheses on the sides are like, and we have (3 * 4) ÷ (8 ÷ 2).But hey, you can distribute - 3 * 4 * 8.Now it boils down to 3 * 4 * (8 ÷ 2).  Now we get F = 4 * (8 * 2).Now use the box trick so it becomes 3 * (4 * 6 * 3) / (8 * 2).After converting the fractions, it's 8 * 3 / 2 = 12.Therefore, the number of cubic feet is 12.Let's exchange it to 2 because#
