Let S be the number of chores a month to save up for his supplies.Saving up for supplies costs $100/4 months = $25 per monthSo a month needs to earn 25 - $10 = $15 per month.Making 15$ from shoveling lawns costs 3 lawns per month.Making 15$ from mowing lawns costs 2 lawns per month.Making 15$ from raking leaves costs 1 leaf per month.Let x be the number of lawns per month he mows.Then a month needs to mow 3 lawns, raking 2 leaves, and shoveling 1 lawn to earn $15 per month.So there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 lawns in a month. Therefore, the equation is 3x + 2x + x = 6.Let's combine the x's first.3x + 2x + x = 6x + 2x = 6 + 2xNow, we distribute 2x to 3x + 2x.3x + 2x = 6(3x + 2x)/2x = 3x/2 + 2 = 3x + 3.Then distribute 3x to 2x.3x + 3x + 3x = 6x2 + 3x2 = 6 + 3x + 3.Therefore, the solution is x = 4 lawns.The answer is 4.question: Smith earns $1.85 per hour. What are the most and least dollars he can#

He can rake and shovel 3 times a day, so $3 for each time.He can mow a lawn 4 times a day, so $4 for each time.So for a month, he can earn $90 - $10 for the supplies he needs.In order to save up for the $100 a month, he can rake, shovel, and mow 3 * 4 * 31 = 228 times.So to save up, he should mow 3 times a day, rake and shovel 4 times a day, and mow 3 * 4 * 31 = 228 times. The answer is 228. question1: Orlando drives his Mustang to work every day.  He drives his Mustang at#

Let x be the average number of chores in a month.Then his season is 4 months long so 4 * x = 96.Since he charges 10 dollars per chore so the cost is 96/10 = 9.6 times the average chores per month.So, 9.6 * x = 96.Distribute the 10 dollars over 4 months so it becomes (10/4) * x = 24.Rearrange the terms to give x = 96/24 = 4 chores per month.Therefore, he needs to have 4 chores per month to be able to afford to purchase the baseball supplies.The answer is 4.Allison's Tips - SAT Algebra 2 practice and review,#

Let S be the number of lawn services he needs to do to save up for the supplies.Since he is averaging 10 services per month, he will do 20 services per season. But the season is 4 months long so we have 20 x 4 = 80.Therefore, S = 80 / 10 = 8 lawn services.The answer is 8.#

Gerald earns $400 a month if he averages 5 jobs per month.As he wants to play baseball for 4 months, he has 4 - 4 = 0 months to rake, shovel, and mow lawns.He has 4 months to rake, shovel, and mow so he has (5 jobs) * (4 months) = 20 jobs a month.He earns $400 a month with 20 jobs a month so he earns $10 per job.But he pays $10 for each job so he earns $100 a month for the baseball supplies.Therefore, he needs to average 10 jobs per month to save for the baseball supplies.The answer is 10.question:#

The number of days in a month is 30. His expenses for baseball are $100/4 = $25. He spends $25 for 4 days of the month.Therefore, the amount he spends per day is $25/30 = $833/3 = $333.Thus, he spends $333 for 31 days a month.So he saves up 333/10 = $33.33 for the other month.Thus, he earns 333 days x $10 = $3300.Then he earns the remaining 3 days by working in a day.So, he earns 10 - $33.33 - 333/10 = $833.33 per month.The answer is 833.33.question: Gary paid for 3 ice cream cones at a price of $2 each. He was planning#

Let x be the number of lawns he mows, y be the number of bushes he rakes, and z be the number of days he rake. The mowing z days a month costs 60 + 20z = 100z.The shoveling x days a month costs 30 + 10x = 100x.The raking y days a month costs 15 + 5y = 100y.So Gerald has a cost function of 100z + 100x + 100y.Adding up the constants on the bottom gives 300 + 100 + 100 = 500.Therefore, to achieve his goal, Gerald needs to minimize his total cost which is 500z + 500x + 500y.Now distribute 500 and 100 to z, x, and y.So we have 500z + 500x + 500y = 500(z + x + y).Then add the x and z terms so we have 500(x + z) + 500y = 500(z + x + y) + 500y = 500(x + z + 2y).Then add the z and y terms together so we have 500(x + z + 2y) + 500(z + x + 2y) = 500x + 500y + 500(2x + 2y) = 500(x + y).This gives x + y = 20 and x + z = 30.Therefore,#

Let x be the number of chores Gerald does in a month.Thus, $100 รท 4 = $25 x is Gerald's monthly spending on baseball supplies. Gerald wants to save up $25 per month for his supplies, so x = $25. He also has to pay $25 for the four months he's not playing baseball. Gerald needs to make a profit of $25 per month, so he needs to rake, shovel, and mow lawns x = 25 months.$10 x = $25$So, x = 5 chores per month. Gerald has to average $5 per month.He can do either 4 chores at $1 each or 3 chores at $2 each.However, if he does 4 chores at $1 each, his profit will be $1 x 4 = $4, which is less than $25. Therefore, he does 3 chores at $2 each.Then, 3 chores at $2 each is equal to $3 x 2 = $6.Therefore, he earns $6 x 3 = $18.The answer is 18.question: The average age#

Let's call Gerald's savings S. Then we know S = (100 * 4) - (10 * 2) = 200.To get the average for the month, we just divide 200 by 4.Therefore, the average S is = 50.The answer is 50.question: Derek and Jessie each make their own lunch. They both put the same amount of money into their lunches.#

Let x be the number of chores.Thus the equation is x = (10 * 4) / 100So, x = (10*4) / 100 = 40So, Gerald needs to do 40 chores a month to save up for his baseball supplies.The answer is 40.question: Marc spent $10.35 to buy baseball cards last year. This year, he spent exactly half of#
