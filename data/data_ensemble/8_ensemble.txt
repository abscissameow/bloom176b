 She paid the $200 to get the set of business clothes. So the cost of each item must add up to the same total.

Her cousin Rachel had a birthday party and got#

Alexis has $16 left from her budget so $200 - 16 = 184 dollars went into the new clothes.She spent $46 on the pants and $38 on the suit coat so she has 122 dollars left for the suit pants and the suit coat.She also spent $11 on socks so the cost for the socks would be 122 - 11 = 121 dollars.Then she spent $30 on the shirt and 18 on the belt, so 121 - 30 - 18 = 74 dollars.Since she lost the receipt for the shoes, she has no proof of the cost of the shoes, but we know that 74 - 16 = 58 went into the shoes.She also put 80 dollars into her shoe fund so the cost of the shoes is 74 + 80 = 144 dollars.The answer is 144.#

The total amount spent is the sum of all the amounts, which is $200 + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = $185.However, the price of the shoes is missing from the list, so we add the $16 to the budget. So, the new budget amount is $200 + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 + 16 = $226.To find the amount spent on shoes, we add $226 to all the other items, so we have 226 + 185 = 441.Divide $441 by 7. That gives $58.8. Since this is not a whole dollar, add a cent.Therefore, she spent $59.10 on the shoes.The answer is 59.10.question: Did you find a hidden message on the#

First, subtract the socks cost from the budget so $200 - 11 = $189. Let S be the cost of the shoes. Then $189 - S = $179.Let P be the price of the suit coat. Then $179 + P = $179 + 46 = $205.Therefore, the suit coat cost 46$. Subtracting the suit coat price from the budget gives $189 - 46 = $153.Similarly, subtracting the price of the shirt from the budget gives $153 - 30 = $123.Then add the sum of the prices to the budget so $153 + 123 = $280.Subtracting the total amount spent from the budget gives $280 - 200 = 80$.Therefore, the amount paid for the shoes is S = 80 - 16 = 64$.The answer is 64$.question: Issac owns 4 comic books#

Let x be the amount paid for the shoes.$11 is for the socks so the equation becomes 11x + (46 + 38 + 30) = $200.11x + 181 = $20011x = 181 + xCombining like terms on the left side gives 18x = $200.18x = $200/18 = $90$90 is for the shoes and socks.Subtract the amount of socks from the total to find the shoes.$90 - 11 = $79$79 is for the shoes and x is the amount of the shoes.The amount paid for the shoes is ($79 + x) - 11 = $69.The answer is $69.question: Sandy enjoyed spending her summer vacation by playing golf. She played in 3#

Let x be the cost of the shoes.Alexis spent $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + 18 = $145 on the clothes.The remainder of her money was $16 so 16 + x = 145.Divide both sides of the equation by 16 to get x = 53/255.The answer is 53/255.question: To clean a bookshelf, Mary#


Alexis spent $200 on the button-up shirt, so she had $180 left.The coat cost $46 and the pants cost $38.Because the belt cost $11, we can subtract the amount of the shirt plus pants plus coat, which equals $180 plus $38 plus $46 = $244.Alexis had $244 - $11 = $233 left.Then $233 - $18 = $215 is the amount for the socks and shoes.When Alexis added $46 to $200 and subtracted $46 from $200 she got $46, which is the amount she spent on the coat.The shoes cost $46 so Alexis spent $46 on the shoes.The answer is $46.question: Bryce had 120 more apples than he had bananas. But#

If Alexis had $16 left from her budget of $200, then the shoes cost $24.In the previous step, we figured out that her budget was $200.By the addition formula, the amount for the shoes is: 200 + 24 = 244.The answer is $24.question: For one of the tests on their math final, Susan was only able to finish one-third#

Let B be the amount that Alexis spent on the shoes. Alexis spent 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 120. The total amount she spent was 200 + 120 = $300. Her budget was $300 + 16 = 316.The budget spent was 316 - 120 = 196.Divide the amount that Alexis spent into her budget to find out how much she spent on the shoes.120 ÷ 196 = 0.6Therefore, the amount that Alexis spent on the shoes was B = $196 ÷ 0.6 = $320.The answer is $320.#

First, we determine how much she spent on clothes.30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 121.The number of shoes she bought is 16 - 121 = -95.So the sum of the values ​​is 200 - 95 = 105.The equation is - 95 + 105 = 120.There are two unknowns so we will add one more equation.This gives $121/100 = 11.50. Therefore, Alexis paid $55 for the shoes.The answer is $55.question: Brooke and Devon have 5 identical baskets and put them on the table.#
