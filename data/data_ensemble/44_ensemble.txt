Let E be the number of dollars spent on coursework materials.Since the budget is $1000, we get E * 10 = 1000.So E = 100.The answer is 100.question:#

Let x be the amount of money James spent on coursework materials.Therefore, $1000 - 30% - 15% - 25% - x = 500.Distribute 30% to the right side of the equation, so it becomes $1000 - 30% - x = $750.Distribute 15% to the right side, so it becomes $750 - x = $625.Distribute 25% to the right side, so it becomes $625 - x = $450.Finally, distribute the 1000 to the right side, so it becomes $450 + 1000 - x = $500.Thus, x = 450 - (1000 - 30% - 15% - 25%) = 225.The answer is 225.question: It#

Let m be the number of dollars James spends on coursework materials.Then m * 0.8 = 0.8 * m.Substituting and expanding, we have 1000 * 0.1 = 0.1 * 1000. Simplifying the equation gives 0.1 = m/1000.Therefore, the number of dollars James spends on coursework materials is m = 0.1 * 1000 = 100.The answer is 100.question: Each hour, an old clock measures the#

Let x be the amount he spends on coursework materials.The equation is 1000 = (30%)*(x) + (15%)*(x) + (25%)*(x) + (10%)*(x)Then distribute 20% to (x) to get x = 800/3 + 200/3 + 400/3 + 100/3.By adding and subtracting we can get x = 1200/3 = 400/3 + 200/3 + 100/3 + 100/3 + 100/3, or x = 1600/3 = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32.So, James spends $512 + $256 + $128 + $64 + $32 on coursework materials.The answer is $512 + $256 + $128 + $64 + $32.question: All of the tiles on the ground were red.

Let a be the number of dollars James spends on coursework materials. Then a represents the remainder after the budget is divided by 5.So we have 1000 / 5 = 200, and 1000 = 200 * 5 + a.Then 25 % of 200 = 50, and 30 % of a = 30.To calculate the cost of the course materials, we have 50 + 30 = 80.Thus the number of dollars James spends on coursework materials is a = 80 - 50 = 30.The answer is 30.question: Sven spent $20 on a parking ticket. He gave a $5#
