Let X be the number of driveways that Tobias shovels.Then, the number of lawns he mows will be 4X.Tobias buys the shoes and has change of $15.Then, to mow 4 lawns, he will have 4(15 + $7) = $28.Then the change Tobias will have will be $15 - (15 + 7 + 28) = $15 - 32 = $8.Now we have 4X + 8 = $32.Solving for X, we have 4X = 32 - 8 = 24.Therefore, there are 24 driveways that Tobias shovels.The answer is 24.question: Maya plays soccer and has been#

Let a = how many driveways he shovels.Then he will have (15 * a + 7 * a) $ = 15 * a $ + 7 * a $ = 95$.Combining like terms and distributing 15 gives a * (15 + 7) = 95.Factoring, 15 + 7 = 22.Thus, a = 22 driveways.The answer is 22.question: A dad is buying his 4-year-old daughter 2 quilts at a fair.

Let x be the number of driveways he shovels.So the number of lawns mowed is 4*x.He gets a $5 allowance for each lawn mowed, plus 15 dollars for each driveway he shovels.Adding these together gives 4*x + 15x = 15 + 4x = $75.Distributing 15 to both sides produces 4*x + 15x = 100.Then adding 4*x to both sides yields 4*x + 15x = 100 + 4x.Therefore, 4*x = 95, or x = 24.The answer is 24.question: Ryan's dad#

Let x be the number of driveways shoveled.From the money he got from the mows, he had $15 which is equivalent to 5x as 5x is the same amount as he got from each mow. He only used a total of 4 lawns, which is equivalent to x as 4x is the same amount of lawns he mowed.Then from the shovels, he had $7 which is equivalent to 2x.Therefore, the amount of money left is $5 - 2x = $3.Multiplying by the number of drives shoveled gives $3x = $20.Combining like terms and dividing by 3 gives $5x = $5.Thus, x = 1 driveway shoveled.The answer is 1.question: In a pizza shop, one pie costs#

 Let x be the number of driveways shoveled.To mow 4 lawns, he must have 15 * 4 = 60 lawns mowed. 60 lawns would require 60 * 15 = 900 minutes of mowing. Then 15 minutes is equivalent to 10 minutes.That would require (60 * 10) / 10 = 6 lawns.Then, he has 15 minutes to shovel the remaining driveways.This would require (15 * 7) = 105 minutes for shoveling driveways. Thus the equation for the number of driveways is (x + 6) / 10 + 6.This equation is in standard form and we can substitute x to get (x + 6) / 10 + 6 = (6 * 10) / 10 + 6.The equation for the number of driveways is 6 * (x + 6) / 10 + 6 = 6 * (6 * x) / 10 + 6.Subtract 6 from each side to get (x + 6) / 10 + 6 - 6 = x / 10 + 6.To solve for x, we have (x + 6) / 10 + 6 - 6 = x / 10 + 6 or (x + 6) / (10 - 6) + 6 = x / (10 - 6#

Let X be the number of driveways that Tobias shovels. Then X = 7 x = 7 X = 7(15 + 4) = 7(19) = 147Tobias charges $15 for mowing lawns so X = 4 lawns.Therefore, Tobias shoveled 4 driveways.The answer is 4.question: A teacher has 24 identical pencils. Two times#

Let D be the number of driveways shoveled. Then $15 * 4 - D = $15.Combining the $15 on both sides of the equation produces $4 * 4 - D = 15.If 4 * 4 = 16 and D = 15 then D = 4.Therefore, D = 4 and D + 4 = 8.D = 8 so there are 8 driveways shoveled.The answer is 8.The four solutions provided by the algorithm are (5, 2), (8, 0), (20, 2), and (8, 4). If the user guesses a#

Let x be the number of driveways shoveled.Tobias buys the shoes, but is still left with 15 dollars in change.He also gets a $5 allowance each month.He makes $15 for mowing 4 lawns and 7 dollars for shoveling a driveway.Therefore, he makes (15 + 5) x 4 + 7x dollars from mowing the lawns and shoveling.And his change is still $15 after buying the shoes, so the equation becomes (15 + 5) x 4 + 7x = 15.Multiply both sides by 15 and distribute the 7 and get 75x + 70x = 150.Then, add 7x to both sides to get 75x + 71x = 151.Recall that 150 = 75 + 75 so we can distribute 75 to both sides, yielding 75x + 76x = 151.To solve for x, we have 76x = 151 - 76 = 75.Therefore, x = 13.The answer is 13.question: Rick needs some money to buy a brand new computer game for a special occasion#

Let C represent the number of driveways. Then 95 - C = 15 + C = 20 + C. Since C is an integer, C must be 15, 30 or 45. Let X represent the number of lawns mowed. Then X + 4 = 15 + 7 * X = 40 + 7 * X = 50 + 7 * X. Since X is an integer, X must be 5, 8 or 11.After buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change, so his balance is 95 - 45 - 15 = $30.Tobias has $30 to use for the rest of the month, so he mows 4 lawns.4 lawns + 4 lawns + 4 lawns + 4 lawns + X = 30 + 15 + 7 * X + 7 * X + 7 * X = 30 + 60 + 7 * (4 + X) = 30 + 60 + 28 = 92, which means that X = 4.So, X = 4.The answer is 4.question: Lucy has 13 apples.

Let x be the number of driveways shoveled.So, we know that Tobias has $95 - $15 = $80 to buy the new pair of shoes.Tobias has $80 - $5 - $17.5 = $15.5 left.We know Tobias mows 4 lawns for $40.So, if we add the two equations, $15.5 + 4 x $40 = $80.$15.5 + 4 x $40 = $80.Therefore, $4 x $40 = $80 - $15.5 = $55.5.4 x $40 = $80 - $15.5 = $55.5.$40 x 4 = $80 - $15.5 = $55.5.$40 x 4 = $80 - $15.5 = $55.5.$40 x 4 = $80 - $15.5 = $55.5.The answer is 4.question: On Friday, Chris ate 12 carro#
