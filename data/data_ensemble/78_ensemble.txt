Let S be the number of slices left.Then, divide 10 by 3 so we have 3 equal pieces.Divide the number of pie by the number of slices per piece to get the number of pieces each received.  He gets 1 piece. His classmates get 24 pieces. And Mr. Keith gets 1 piece.Or, divide the number of pies by the total number of slices to get the number of slices each student gets.  Manny gets 3 slices; his classmates gets 30 slices; and Mr. Keith gets 2 slices. Therefore, 3 cubic pies divide by 10 = 30 slices per piece.3 * 30 = 90 pieces. From the classmates get 2 x 90 = 180 pieces. Part of each slice is still remaining. Therefore, 90 - 30 = 60 - 2 = 58 slices.The answer is 58.question:#

First, let x be the number of pieces from the teacher's pie.So there are 3 x 10 pieces from the teacher's pie.Thus, there is (5x + 9) pieces from all the (3 + 24) pies.Combining the constants on both sides produces (3x + 25) pieces.Since Manny has his 1 piece, the classmates have (3 + 24) pieces.So the equations left are (3x + 25) - 1 - (3 + 24) = 10(3 + 24) - 1 - (5x + 9) session.question: Prashant drives 10 miles in 40 minutes and has to refuel once during this trip.  Likewise, Jasmine continuously drives 10 miles at a steady rate for 90 minutes.  If she fills up her tank once just before venturing out, how much fuel does Prashant need?answer: Let y be the number of minutes needed for Prashant.10 * 40 / 60 = 2 minutes#

Let A be the total number of slices that were cut and the teacher decided to have his fifth slice.Then if we let 20 be the number of person in the classroom and let P be the number of pieces the teacher took than, the possible combinations are 20 * 10 and 20 * 9 to yield a total of 80. Subtracting those slices from A leaves 20 for the teacher to have.Because the teacher divided his piece in 2 and put 1 in everyone's hand and yet another from a 3 slice pie...that gets us to 20 * 12.20 * 11 for another student and 20 * 10 leaves us 20 left.Finally his teacher had 2, then a piece of the pie equals the number of slices that were cut up.The answer is A = 120 slices.The answer is#

Let C be the number of his classmates and S be the number of slices left from each cookie pie. We want to know how many cookie pies were given to his classmates so we multiply 3 - C first. 3 C is equivalent to all 45 cookies given to everyone or one cookie for each person and C + 1 cookies that Manny ate.3 C + C + 1 = 45.Therefore, in all 60 cookies were distributed. Also 60 ÷ 10 = 6. So, S = 10 - 6 = 4.  The answer is the number of slices; 6.The answer#

Let A be the number of slices left.With Manny, we have 24A + 3 = 108.With each student, we have 10A + 24E = 108.Each student also has 10 more than Manny, so we have 10A = 10E + 10.Adding the 2 equations together gives 10A + 24A + 24E = 108.Distributing 24 to the equation as 24A + 24E gives 10A -10A = 108.A = 12.The answer is 12.question:#

Manny had 3 pieces of pie, and each of his classmates and his teacher ate 1 piece.Therefore, the teacher must ate (1 * (10+2) = 12 slices of pie.Given the number of pieces eaten by the teacher, each slice that was cut contained 10-12 slices.Thus, the number left was 10-12 * 10 = 8 slices.The answer is 8.#

In this case, x will be the number of slices.Then the teacher, Mr. Keith will have 3x apples.Manny and the others will be 7x and 24x.Adding all the variables gives 3x + 7x + 24x = 10(x+1) + 7(x+1) + 24(x+1).Simplifying, only keeping one variable on each side, results in 3x + 7x + 24x = 10(3x + 7x + 24) Simplifying, having all variables in same term on left side, gives 4x+1=30 and then distributing, results in 4x + 30/4 = 30 and reducing gives 4x = 15.Finally, the number of leftover slices is 15-24x-1= 20 (Automatically found by the program).The answer is 20.question:#

Manny is considered person number 1. Then Mr. Keith is person number 25 and the classmates are 2 through 24.The number of seconds each person has is 3 + 25 + (24 x 9) = 1 + 370 = 371 seconds.The number of slices is 371 : 10 = 37.The classmates left has 125 37 slices. The teacher left 0 37 slices.Tangentially, there are now 8 8 slices in the cookie pies left.Maximo shared 3 slices of 3 pies with Maxwell and 1 slice with Mr. Keith so there are now 8 - 1 - 3 = 4 slices left.The answer is 4 slices.  question:Phil ran for 4 laps. Every#

Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith together have 3 + 24 = 27 people altogether. If each piece equals 10 slices, then all the pieces would be 27/10 = 3 more than 27 slices.But the pieces only equal 27 slices.28 - 27 = 1.Therefore, one more piece had to equal 23 more slices, and all the slices were out of the original pieces.23 = 23/10.The whole number that is closest to 23/10 is 3/5.In conclusion, 3/5 of a piece was added to each original piece.Cinderella had 3 pieces, thus she had 27/5 = 7 pieces.Her teacher had 3 more pieces so he had 9 slices.The answer is 7.question:#

Let the number of slices in each pie be k and the number of pies be r.Then 3k per day gives the number of slices consumed per day.  After 13 days, there will be 3k + 13k = 39k.At that time, 1 of each of the remaining 2slices will be given to classmates.Therefore, the number of remaining slices following the 13th day will be 39k – 22k = 17k.  Mr. Keith had also consumed k slices so that on the 13th day remaining will be 17k – 15k = 2k.The answer is 2k.question:#
