Initially, the box weighed 2 pounds and Ken added 2 pounds of jelly beans so the jelly beans weighed 4 pounds. Ken then added another 2 pounds of gummy worms so they also weighed 4 pounds.Therefore, the box weighed 8 pounds.question: A class of math students was given a#

Let x be the final weight. Then 2 + 3x + 2 + 2x = 6 pounds.Solving for x, we have 2 + 3 * x + 2 + 2 * x = 6.Rearranging the equation we have x + 2 + 2 * x = 6 + 3x or 3x + 2x = 6.Then solve for x, we have x = (6 - 2 - 2) / 3 = 1 pound.Therefore, the weight of the box of goodies is 1 pound.The answer is 1.question: There are 27 million cars registered in the United States.  There#

Since we already know the jelly beans and gummy worms weigh 2 pounds each, the final weight of the package will be 3 pounds. The brownies weigh 3 times as much as the jelly beans.  Therefore, the final weight of the package will be 9 pounds. The number of gummy worms was doubled.  Therefore, the number of gummy worms is 6.  Therefore, the number of jelly beans is 3 * 2 + 3 + 2 = 9.Therefore, the number of brownies is 9/2 = 4.The answer is 9 pounds.question: Each year, one third#

Let x be the number of pounds.Then the weight of the 2 pounds of jelly beans is 2x.Also, the weight of the brownies is 3x.Since the weight is tripled, the number of pounds is 3 * x.Then, the weight of the 2 pounds of jelly beans is 2x again.So, the weight of the brownies + the weight of the 2 pounds of jelly beans is 6x + 2x.Then, the weight of the 2 pounds of jelly beans is 2x so 2x + 6x + 2x = 12x.And the weight of the brownies is 3x so 12x = 3x + 3x + 2x.Then distribute 2x to the 3x on the right side so it becomes 3x = 12x.Finally, divide both sides by 3 so 12/3 = 4.Therefore, x = 4 pounds.The answer is 4 pounds.question: Mary was given a#

To figure out how many jelly beans were in the box, we have 2 x 3 = 6, so the equation is 2x + 2 = 6. This simplifies to 2 = 2 - 4/x. The negative sign gives us 2 x 2 = 4. This simplifies to x = 4/2 = 2 jelly beans.We know the weight of the brownies is 2 pounds, so there are 2x = 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of brownies.Now we know 2x + 2 = 6 and 2x = 4. Then the equation is 2 + 2 - 4x = 6. This simplifies to 2 - 4x = 6 and 2x = 4.Subtracting 4x from both sides gives 2 - 4x = 6 - 4x.Substitute x for 4/4 to get 2 - 8/4 = 6 - 4x.Substitute x for 4/2 to get 2 - 16/2 = 6 - 4x.Substitute x for 2x to get 2 - 32 = 6 - 4x.Subtract 2 from both sides to get 24 = 6 - 4x.The final weight is 2 - 32 = 2 x 24 = 32 pounds.The answer is 32.question: A digital clock on the wall of the#


Let y be the number of jelly beans, x be the number of brownies, and z be the number of gummy worms.So, we know that 2 pounds of jelly beans weighs 2*80 = 160 oz.160 = y + z + x.Then, we have 2y = 160.To solve for y, we have 160/2 = 80.Therefore, y = 80.Since 2y = 160, we have 80*2 = 160.Therefore, the weight of the jelly beans is 80 * 2 = 160.The answer is 160.question: Sam and Katy#

Let W be the weight of the box of goodies, in pounds. So there are 3 W jelly beans, 4 W brownies, and 2 W gummy worms.Let x be the weight of the box, in pounds. Then, x = 2 * 3 W + 4 W + 2 W.Then x = 3 W + 4 W + 2 W = 9 W.And now, substituting this expression for x in the original equation, we obtain 3 W + 4 W + 2 W + 2 W = 2 * 3 W + 4 W + 2 W = 9 W.Combining terms on the left side gives 3 W + 4 W = 9 W.Subtracting 2 W from both sides gives 3 W = 6 W.Therefore, there are 3 x W = 6 W.Then 6 W = 6 x = x.The answer is x = 9 pounds.#

Ken added 2 pounds of jelly beans, so there are now 2 + 2 = 4 pounds of jelly beans.Ken added 3 pounds of brownies so there are now 3 + 4 = 7 pounds of brownies.Ken added 2 pounds of gummy worms so there are now 2 + 7 = 9 pounds of gummy worms.Finally, there are 2 + 9 = 11 pounds of gummy worms.The answer is 11 pounds.question: Sammie was at an amusement park#


Let x be the number of gummy worms added to the box of goodies.Then the weight of the box is 2 pounds before the worms are added.After adding 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight of the box is 6 pounds.When x pounds of jelly beans are added, the box weight is 2x pounds.And after adding 2 pounds of brownies, the box weight is 6x pounds.So the total weight is 2x + 6x + (2x + 6x) = 2x + 12x + 12.The weight is 2x + 12x + 12 + 2 = 14x + 16 = 14x + 14 pounds.The box weighs 14x + 14 pounds.So the final weight is 14x + 14 x 2 = 14x + 28 pounds.The answer is 14x + 14 x 2 = 28 pounds.question: Nathan is really into his films#

At the beginning, the box had 2 pounds of jelly beans. And then he added enough brownies so the weight triples.Since the weight of the brownies is a multiple of 3, adding jelly beans would result in weights that are also multiples of 3.The equation for the jelly bean part would be 3y.Multiplying by 3 would result in weights that are multiples of 3.The expression would be 3y*3.The weight of the box of goodies would be 2 + 3y*3.Let y = 2 so the expression would become 2 + 6y*3.Then distribute 6 over 2 and y so it becomes 2 + 3(6*2) + 12y.The 12y term has a coefficient of 6, and therefore, it can be distributed.The expression then becomes 2 + 36 + 6y.Then distribute 36 over 6 and y so it becomes 2 + 36 + 18y.The answer is 72.question: Sam's cat, Susie, has 12#
