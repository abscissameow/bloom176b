Let S be the amount of money spent by Sara on shoes and a dress.To spend twice as much as Sara did, that would mean S = 200 + 100 = 300.So Rachel should spend 300/2 = 150 on a pair of shoes and a dress.The answer is 150.question:#

Let x be the amount that Rachel spends on the pair of shoes.Therefore, the expression would be 2 * x = 2x.To solve for x, we have 2 * x = 2x \implies x = x.So, the amount that Rachel spends on the pair of shoes is x = x = x.Similarly, the amount that Rachel spends on the dress is x = x = x.Therefore, the amount that Rachel spends on the pair of shoes and dress is 2 * x = 2x = x + x = 2x + x = 2x + x = 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x = 2x + 2x + 2x = 2x + 2x + 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2(x + x) = 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 2(x + x) + 2x + 2x = 2(x#

Let x be the price of the shoes and the dress that Sara buys. So x = 50 + 200.Sara spends twice as much as Rachel does on the shoes and the dress. That is x/2 = 75.Divide both sides by 50 to get 2x = 100 + 200.Squaring both sides produces 4x = 1000.Subtracting 100 from both sides produces 3x = 900.Adding 200 to both sides produces 3x = 900 + 200.Divide both sides by 200 to get 3x = 300.Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 300/2 = 150.The answer is 150.question: Ellie put a jar on a table.

Let M be the money that Rachel has to spend. The model and beauty contest will cost Sara x, so we know x = $200 + $50. Similarly, we know that x = 2M. Subtract 2 from both sides to obtain M = x - 2.So M = $200 - 2 = $198. Since Sara spent $50 on a pair of shoes and $200 on the dress, M should be $198 + $50 + $200. Thus M = $400.Rachel should budget $400 if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent.The answer is $400.question: Mr. Throughout watched a clock face for 8 hours and 45 minutes.#

Let x be the amount that Rachel spends on the shoes and dress.Then 2x + 100 = 200.Since Sara spent $50 + $200 = $250, she should be 2x = 50 + 200 = 250.Then 2x = 250 - 100 = 150.Rachel should spend x = 150 - 100 = 50 dollars on her dress and shoes.The answer is 50.question: Talia bought#

Let y be the amount of money Rachel spends on shoes.Then Sara's budget for shoes is 2x.Also, the amount of money Rachel spends on dresses is 2x.The total budget for shoes and dresses is y + 2x = y + 2x + 2x = 2x + 2x = 4x = 300$.Therefore, Rachel spends 300$.The answer is 300$.question: The administrator has three cubic meters of wood and must make twelve cubic meters of lumber.

Let S = Sarah's budget for shoes and dress. Let R = Rachel's budget for shoes and dress.S + S + S = R + R + RSo, 2S + S = R + 2R and 100 + 200 = 500So 2S = R + 1002S = R + 500 -S = R - 450 and R = S + 450The answer is S = $450 + 450 = 900.question: Alex completed 20 reps in each round of his workout#

First, find out how much Sara spends. $50 + 200 = 250Then, find out how much Rachel needs to spend.2*(50 + 200) = 250Since Rachel spends twice as much on the shoes and the dress, she should spend 250 + 250 = 500.The answer is 500.question: There were 7 children in this family. There are now 4 children. How many#

Let S be the cost of the pair of shoes and D be the cost of the dress.Sara has spent S + D = 250.So, Rachel must budget 2x(S + D) = 250.Distributing 2x to S + D produces 2xS + 2xD = 250.Simplifying this equation gives S + D = 250/2 = 125.Rachel spends $200 on the dress and $50 on the shoes so that equals to S + D = 75.The answer is 75.#

Let A be the amount that Rachel spent for the pair of shoes and dress.She bought a pair of shoes which cost $50 and a dress which cost $200.Sara bought a pair of shoes which cost $50 and a dress which cost $200.If she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress, then 50A + 200A = 100A + 200A.Then distribute 200 to the right side of the equation, so the equation becomes 200A = 100A + 200.If she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress, then the left side of the equation should be 200A.Since we can distribute 200 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 100A + 200A = 200A.Now we can combine like terms on the left side of the equation, so it becomes 100A + 100A = 200A.Then we can solve for A by distributing 100 to both sides of the equation, so it becomes 100A = 200.Now we can solve for A by using simple subtraction, so it becomes A = 200/50 = 40.The amount that Rachel spent for the pair of shoes and dress is A = 40.The answer is 40.question: Frank#
