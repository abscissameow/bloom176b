Roque took x hours to walk to work and y hours to bike to work.Then he walks 3x times and bikes 2x times so he rides in total x + y = 5x times.He walked to work for 2 hours a day so he spends 20 hours a week on walking to work.Then he rode his bike to work for 1 hour a day so he spends 10 hours a week on biking.Therefore, the total amount of time spent each week is 20 + 10 = 30 hours.The answer is 30.question: It takes Carmen 1 minute to drive her car to work#

Let x be the number of hours Roque takes to get to and from work.Then Roque walks to and from work three times a week, so 3x = 3x days * 2 hours each day = 6x hours in a week.Similarly, Roque rides his bike to and from work twice a week, so 2x = 2x days * 1 hour each day = 2 x hours in a week.So, the time taken to get to and from work is 6x + 2x = 8x hours in a week.Therefore, 8x = 7 * 24 = 168 hours in a week.The answer is 168.question: Regina is putting the seat on her bicycle in preparation for a race. The front#

Roque walks for 4 hours in total, bike for 2 hours in total.The answer is 2 hours.question: Bob has 15 bananas and he eats one-third of the bananas. How many does#

Roque biked two hours every other day and rode 1 hour the other day, so in total, he biked a total of 4 hours. On the days that he was not biking, he walked to work for 2 hours. Thus Roque walked for a total of 4 hours. Roque walked or biked a total of 6 hours every weekday. The week had 7 days, so Roque took to work for a total of 42 hours a week. The correct answer is 42 hours.#

Let W be the number of times that he walks to and from work in a week, and B the number of times that he bikes to and from work.Then the total number of hours W + B = 2, because it takes him 2 hours each way to walk or bike. Also, 3 * (W + B) = 2 because walking and biking gets him to work every day.Therefore, the equation becomes 2 = W + B + 3W.Combining like terms produces 5W = W + B.Solving for W gives W = 2 / 5.Therefore, he walks to and from work two times a week.The answer is 2.question: Ace baked#

Roque takes 2x + y + 2y = 4 hours to work where x is the number of hours that he rides his bike and y is the number of hours he walks.Adding this equation to y + y + y = 2 which tells how much time he takes to work and subtracting x = 2 from the end results in 2x = 6.So he rides his bike for 2x = 6 hours.He walks for y = 2 hours. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. So 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, 6 - 2 = 4.So Roque rides his bike for 4 hours and walks for 2 hours.The answer is 4 hours.question: The#

Let x be the number of hours spent each week on the bike.Then Roque spends 2x hours on the bike a week.For the 3 days that Roque walks, he spends 3 * 1 hours walking.For the 2 days that Roque bikes, he spends 2x * 2 hours.Thus, the equation we have is: 3x + 2x * 2 = 8.Rearranging the terms, 3x + 8 = 8.Simplifying 3x + 8 = 8, gives 3x = 8.And so, the value of x is 4 hours.The answer is 4.question: Larry traveled from#

Let x be the number of hours in a week.Then Roque walks to and from work three times a week which is 3 * x hours. Roque also rides his bike to and from work twice a week which is 2 * x hours.Subtracting this from the total number of hours in a week gives us 6 * x hours of his journey to work.Adding up his time to work in a week gives us 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 hours to work.We want to know how much of this is with the bike which is 2x.We need to multiply 2x by 3 times to get 6 so 2x * 3 = 6. Thus Roque rides his bike 6 hours.Therefore, he bikes to work twice a week which takes him 6 hours. So the total time taken to and from work a week with walking and biking is 24 + 6 = 30 hours.The answer is 30.question: If the sum of a collection of 28 numbers is one third of the sum#

The number of hours Roque rides to work is given by x = 2 hours / 3 = 2.5 hours.And the number of hours Roque walks to work is y = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.Thus the total number of hours Roque takes to go to work is x + y = 3.5 hours.The answer is 3.5.question: A flock of seagulls#

Roque walked x minutes and rode his bike y minutes so the total time for one trip is x + y minutes. Roque had three trips a week so 3x + 2y = 7.Subtracting 3y from both sides produces 3x - 3y = 7.Since x and y are whole numbers, x - y must be positive. So x - y = 7/3 = 2.Therefore, the total amount of time Roque walks plus the total amount of time he rides a bike is 3x + 2y = 2x + 3y = 4y + y = 5y. So Roque takes 5 hours a week to get to and from work.The answer is 5. question of the day!#
