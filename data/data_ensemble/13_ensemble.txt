Let x be the number of dollars Jasper spent on the ingredients. Then 2 pounds of cheddar cheese costs x + 10 = 10 + 2x.Adding the price of the cream cheese gives 2x + 2(x + 1/2x) = 10 + 2x.Multiply both sides by 1/2 to give 2x + 2(x + x) = 10 + 2x.Dividing both sides by 2 gives x + x = 6.Thus, the price of the cream cheese is 6.Then the number of dollars Jasper spent would be 10 + 6 = 16.The price of the cold cuts is 16 + 2(10 + 2x) = 20 + 4x.The answer is 16 + 2(20 + 4x) = 36 + 8x.The expression simplifies to 48x = 36 +#

Let x be the price of the cheese.Then 2x + 50 = 10 for the price of the cheese and cream cheese combined.For the price of the cheese and cold cuts combined, we can substitute the price of the cheese for x. Therefore, 50 + 2(2x) = 10.Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 50 = 2(2x) - 10.Solving for x gives x = 10/50 = 20.Therefore, Jasper's total costs will be 10 + 50 + 20 = 80.The answer is 80.question: Sammy read three books last week and finished the#

Let a be the number of pounds of cheddar cheese that he buys. Let b be the number of pounds of cream cheese. Let c be the number of pounds of cold cuts that he buys.Then the equation is 10 * a + 5 * b + 2 * c = $50.For it to be true, 10 * a + 5 * b + 2 * c must be divisible by $50.So if we subtract 10 * a + 2 * c from each side of the equation, 5 * b must be divisible by $50.The equation simplifies to 50 - 10 * a + 2 * c = 5 * b.So then a + c = 10 and b = 50 - 20 - 2 = 38.And the original equation is 10 * a + 2 * c = 50 - 10 * a + 2 * c = 30.Then 50 - 10 * a + 2 * c = 10 * a + 2 * c = 40.And 10 * a + 2 * c = 50 - 10 * a + 2 * c = 40.And 10 * a + 2 * c = 40.And then a + 2c = 10 + 2 * 10 = 20.And a + c = 10 and b = 38.So the number of pounds of cheese and cold cuts he buys is a = 2 and c = 10.The number of cream cheese pounds he buys is#

Let A be the number of pounds of cheese that Jasper buys, B be the number of pounds of cold cuts, and C be the price of the cream cheese in dollars.Now, we have 10 + C + 2 = B + 2 since he spent $2 on the pack of cold cuts.Also, we have C + 2 = B since he spent $1 on the cream cheese.Similarly, 2C = A + B since he spent $2 on both types of cheese.By putting the values of A, B, and C from the equation in the last line, we get 2A + 2C = 2B.So, 2A = 2B + C, so A = B + C.Therefore, Jasper spent $(B + C) = 10 + 2(B + C) = 10 + 2(B + C) = $22 on the ingredients.The answer is $22.question#

Let x represent the cost of the cheddar cheese and y represent the cost of the cold cuts.Jasper spent $10 on the cheddar cheese and he spent $40 on the ingredients. So, 40 = 2x + 2y.Separating out variables gives 10 = x and 10 = y.Divide 10/x by 10/y to get 10/y = 10/x and hence y = x.The answer is 10.question: Moo likes puzzles and playing with her friends.#

Let a, b, and c represent the price of the cheddar cheese, the cream cheese, and the cold cuts respectively.There are 2 pounds of cheddar cheese so 2a = $10$.There is a pound of cream cheese so $2a = 2b$.The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese so 2c = $10 + (b + a)$.Squaring both sides of the last equation gives $32 = (c + 2b + 2a)^2$.Then the equation simplifies to $16 = (c + 2b + 2a)$.Subtracting 2a from both sides of the equation gives $16 = c + 2b + 4 - 2a$.Then we have 2 equations to solve for the 2 unknowns.The cheddar cheese costs $10 + 4 - 2a$.Thus, $(c + 2b + 2a)$ = (10 + 4 - 2a).Plugging the values in gives $a = 5$.The cheddar cheese is $2b = 20$.The cream cheese is $2a = 20$.The cold cuts are $2c = 20 + (20 + 5) = 65$.There are $2b + 2a = 40$ cheddar cheese.So the equation gives $2c = 65 - (40 + 5) = 40$.The answer#

We know that the price of the cheddar cheese was $10. Now, we also know that the price of the cold cuts was 2 times the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the price of the cheddar cheese was $10, we can assume that the price of the cold cuts was $20. Now, we know that the price of the cream cheese was half the price of the cheddar cheese. However, we don't know the price of the cream cheese. Now, the price of the cream cheese was half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since we know that the price of the cheddar cheese was $10, we can then determine the price of the cream cheese was $5. Thus, the equation is 10 + 5 + 20 = $50. Now, we can cancel out the $10 because we know that the price of the cold cuts was $20. The equation becomes $10 + 5 + 20 = $30.The answer is $30.Have fun!#

Let x be the cost of the cold cuts.The total cost is 10 + 2x + x + 5/2.10 + 2x is the cost of the cheddar cheese and the cream cheese.10 + 2x = 10 + 2x + x + 5/2.Combining like terms on the left side gives 2x = 15.Divide both sides by 2.2x = 7.The number of cold cuts is x = 7.The number of cold cuts is 7.The answer is 7.#

We have $10 + (1.5 * 10) + 2 * (1.5 * 10) = 40 + 30 + 60 = 110.Therefore Jasper spent $110 on the ingredients.question: During a presentation, Mr. Butler presented 90 words per minute and his students learned half as many words as Mr. Butler did.
