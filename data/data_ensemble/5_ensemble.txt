The number of yellow flowers is 3 * 10 = 30 flowers.Then 80% of the yellow flowers is 3 * 10 * 80/100 = 24 flowers.Then, there are 30% of the yellow flowers, which is 10 * 30 * 30/100 = 18 flowers.Therefore, the total number of yellow flowers is 30 + 24 + 18 = 74 flowers.The number of purple flowers is 30% of 74 flowers which is 18 + 30% = 24 flowers.Thus, the total number of flowers is 74 + 24 = 98 flowers.The answer is 98 flowers.#


Let x be the number of flowers of any color.Yellow plants = 10.Plants of color purple = 10 x.8 = 8.Plants of color green = 10 x.25 = 2.All plants = 10 + 8 + 2 = 22.The number of flowers is 3 * x = 3x = 3 * (10 + 8 + 2) = 3x = 44.The answer is 44.question: Betsy put 5 ping pong balls in each of 3 pockets in her#

There are 10 yellow, 60 x 80% = 48 purple, and 10 x 25 = 25 green flowers.The total number of flowers is 10 + 60 + 25 = 85.The answer is 85.question: Lucy wants to buy 4 of the same kind of eggs at the store. But at the#

Let y be the number of yellow flowers, and z be the number of purple flowers.Then the number of green flowers is y*.8 + z*.25 = y*.8 + y*.8 = y^2.8 + y = y(1 + 1.8) = y + 1.8yThe sum of yellow and purple flowers is 10 + z = 10 + 1.25*z = 10 + 0.25(z + 10) = 10 + 0.25(z + y) = 10 + 0.25(z + y + 1.8y) = 10 + 1.25y + 1.8y + 0.25(z + y + 1.8y)The original equation, y*.8 + z*.25 = z*.8 + y*.8, now becomes:1.25y + 1.8y + 0.25(z + y + 1.8y) = 10 + 1.25y + 1.8y + 0.25(z + y + 1.8y)When we multiply each side of this equation by y, we gety^2.25 + 2.8y + 0.25z = 10 + 1.25y + 1.8y + 0.25(z + 1.8y)Which yields y^2.25 + 2.8y = 10 + 1.25y + 1.8#

 Let x be the number of yellow flowers, and y be the number of purple flowers.Because there are ten yellow flowers, x = 10.The number of purple flowers is 10 * 80% of the yellow flowers, or 8 * 10 = 80.Let z be the number of green flowers, so we can write z = x + y + z = 10 + 80 + 10 = 90.Then y = x * 0.8, or 8 * 10 * 0.8 = 64.Because there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow flowers, there are z / 25% = 90 / 25 = 36 green flowers.The answer is 10 yellow flowers, 64 purple flowers, and 36 green flowers.question: Keith bought a few comic books from his dad. Later, he found#

The number of flowers is the sum of the number of green flowers and the number of purple flowers. There are 90% as many green flowers as there are purple flowers.The number of purple flowers is the sum of yellow flowers and purple flowers. The sum of the flowers is 10 + 80% + 25% of 10 + 90% = 30, so the number of purple flowers is 10 + 15 = 25.Thus, there are 25 + 10 = 35 purple flowers in Mark's garden.The answer is 35.#

There are 30 flowers in total. 3 * 10 = 30 flowers of each color. 10 yellow flowers + 10 purple flowers + 10 green flowers = 30 flowers. 10 yellow flowers / 3 = 3 yellow flowers.There are (10 * 0.8) / 0.25 = 16 purple flowers.Therefore, 16 purple flowers + 3 yellow flowers = 19 purple flowers.The answer is 19.question#

 Let x be the number of yellow flowers. And let y be the number of green flowers.Then the number of yellow flowers is 3 * x, and so are the number of purple flowers.So, the number of yellow and purple flowers is 3 * x + y.Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, the number of yellow flowers is x * 80/100 = 8 * x%.And the number of green flowers is 4 * y * 1/25.Thus, the equation is 3 * 8 * x% + 4 * y * 1/25 = 10.This simplifies to 3x + (4 * y * 1/25) = 10.First, distribute the 4 to the 4/y term.So, 3 * x + 4 * y = 10.Then distribute the 4 to the y term so the equation becomes 3 * x + 4y = 10.Since 4y = 20 and 3 * x = 30, the equation becomes 30 + (20 * 1/25) = 10.Therefore, x = 5.The answer is 5.question: Jack spent his#

Let Y be the number of yellow flowers. Let P be the number of purple flowers.Let G be the number of green flowers.We know there are 10 yellow flowers and 10 + 10 * 80 / 100 = 12 purple flowers.We know there are 10 + 12 * 25 / 100 = 12 green flowers.Adding these three terms, we know the number of flowers in Mark's garden is Y + P + G = 10 + 12 + 12 = 30 flowers.By dividing this expression by 3, we get Y + P + G = 30 / 3 = 10 flowers each of the three colors.Therefore, Mark has 30 / 3 = 10 plants of each of the three colors.The answer is 10.question: In a large factory, the manager divides $84,000 into seven groups#

Let Y be the number of yellow flowers. Then there are Y + 80(3 - Y) green flowers.There are 75 green flowers total, so 75 = Y + 80(3 - Y).Solving for Y gives Y = 75(1/3 - 1/4) or Y = 7.There are 3 times more yellow flowers than purple flowers so Y = 7 and Z = 21.Therefore, Mark has 7 yellow flowers, 21 purple flowers, and 54 green flowers.The answer is 75/3.question: Chance and her friends decided to make themselves look good.
