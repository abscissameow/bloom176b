Let A be the number of shells that Alan collected. Let B be the number of shells Ben collected.Let C be the number of shells that Laurie collected.Since Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben, then A = 4 * B.Since Ben collected three times as many shells as Laurie, then B = 3 * C.Then we have 4 * 3 * C = 36.Simplifying, we get 12 * C = 36.Distributing the 12 gives 3C = 12.Thus, the number of shells Alan collected is A = 3 * 12 = 36.The answer is 36.#

Let X be the number of shells that Alan collected. Ben collected 4X shells and Laurie collected 6X shells.Thus the total number of shells collected is 6X + 4X = 36 shells. Thus, we have the equation 6X + 4X = 36. Distribute the 6, so it becomes 6X + 4X + 4X = 36.Now transfer the 4 on the right side to the left side, so it becomes 6X + 12X = 36.Add 6X to each side, so it becomes 12X = 36 + 6X. Then, solve for X to get X = 4. Therefore, Alan collected 4 shells.The answer is 4.question:#

Let A be the number of shells that Alan collected. Let B be the number of shells that Ben collected. Then the number of shells that Laurie collected would be A * 3 + B.So, by multiplication we have 3 * A + B = 36.Simplifying and distributing 3 yields A + 3*B = 36.So, 52 = 3*B - 36 - A.We know 52 = B + 8 = B + 9 - A.Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to get 8 + B = 53 - A.Then substitute A + B for B to get 26 + B = 53 - A.Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2.26/2 + B/2 = 53 - A/2.Then subtract A/2 from both sides of the equation to get 26/2 - A/2 = 53 - A/2 - B/2.Rename the terms so the equation becomes A + B - A/2 = 53/2 - B/2.This becomes A + B = 53 - A/2 - B/2.The answer is 53 - A/2 - B/2.question: What is the true relationship between Joe, Jill, and Joey? A. Joey has#

Let A be the number of shells collected by Alan. Then A*4 = B*3. Combining like terms yields A = (B*3)/4. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 yields A = B*2/4.Thus the number of shells collected by Alan is A = B * 2 / 4.The answer is B * 2 / 4 = B * 1/2 / 2 = B / 2.question: Duane ate 3 times as much as his sister did but his#

Let A be the number of shells Alan collected.Let B be the number of shells Ben collected.Then we can express the number of shells collected by Laurie as A * 4 + B.Because Laurie collected 36 shells, it is A * 4 + B = 36.The equation becomes: B = 36 / 4 + A.This equation is not in its simplest form, so let's put A + B = 36.With 36 on both sides of the equation, the equation simplifies to: B = 8 + A.This equation is now in its simplest form, so we know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did.Then let's calculate the number of shells Ben collected: B = 8 + A = 8 + 4 = 12.Therefore, Alan collected 36 shells and Ben collected 12 shells.The answer is 36.question: Brandy and her brother are riding their bikes on#

Let A be the number of shells that Alan collected. Then 4A - (3B + 12) = 36.Adding the term 3B + 12 = 36 and transferring it to the left side gives 3A = (36 + 12) = 48.Distribute 4 to the 48 so it becomes 48/4 = 12.Thus, Alan collected 12 shells.The answer is 12.question: Why did #

Let x be the number of shells collected by Alan.Then x + 4*x = 36.Factoring 4 from each side gives 3*x = 36.Solving for x, x = 18 shells.Therefore Alan collected 18 shells.The answer is 18.question: Jose has a basketball to practice#

Let x be the number of shells that Alan collected.So, Ben's collection is x / 3 and Laurie's collection is 3 * x.Therefore, the number of shells that Alan collected is x + 3 * x = 4 * xThe answer is 3 * x.question: The day after#

Let x be the number of shells Alan collected.So Alan's shells are 4*(x) and Ben's shells are 3x.Laurie's shells are 36.Let y be the number of shells collected by Laurie.So, 3x + 4(x) + 36 = 36The equation becomes (4x + 36)/(3x) = 36/36.This simplifies to 4x = 18.Then, x = (18/(4*36)) = (3)/4 = 6.Alan collected 6 shells.The answer is 6.#

Let x be the number of shells that Alan collected.Then x/4 = Alan's number of shells. Also x/3 = Ben's number of shells.Thus we can write x = 4/3 * (x/3 + 36).Dividing both sides by 4/3 yields 3 * x = 36.Then to solve for x, we use the distributive property so we have 3 * x = 36.We then transfer 3 to both sides of the equation to give 3x = 36.To solve for x we use the distributive property again.So we have 3 * x = 36, and x = 12.Thus, Alan's number of shells is 12.The answer is 12.question#
