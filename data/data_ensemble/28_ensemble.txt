The fifth house has (B + 1) gnomes.Let x be the number of gnomes on the fifth house.So the first house has (B + 1) gnomes as well.Thus, the number of gnomes on the first house = x + (B + 1).The other four houses have B + 1 gnomes, giving 4(B + 1) gnomes.Therefore, the total number of gnomes on the street is (4(B + 1)) + (x + (B + 1)) = 5x + 20.The equation 20 = 5x has one solution, which is x = 5.So the fifth house has 5 gnomes.The answer is 5.question: Cathy's sister told her she bought 3 new books. But the day#

Let x be the number of gnomes in the fifth house.The number of gnomes in each of the four houses is 3.Thus, there are 4x + 20 gnomes on the street.4x + 20 = 20.Subtracting the two 20's leaves 4x = 4.Therefore, the fifth house has 4 gnomes.The answer is 4.question: A customer wanted a bowl#

Let x be the number of gnomes in the fifth house.The total number of gnomes on the street is 20.And the total number of gnomes in all the houses is 20 + 3x.The first four houses have a total of 20 gnomes. Thus, 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 80 gnomes.Therefore, we have 80 + 3x = 20.Distributing 20 to 3x gives 3x + 80 = 20.And we can solve for x, since we have 80 - 3x = 20.Using the equation, 80 - 3x = 20, we obtain 3x = 60.Substituting the value of 3x gives x = 60/3 = 20 gnomes in the fifth house.The answer is 20.question: Our math book contains 12 puzzles. Each of the#

First we want to find how many gnomes there are on the street.There are 20 gnomes in the first 4 houses plus 3 gnomes in each house in the fifth house.20 + 3 * 5 = 23This is because there are 4 houses with 3 gnomes in each house, and then there is the fifth house with only 1 gnome.The answer is 23 gnomes.question#

Let A be the number of gnomes on the street.The first four houses have 5 x 3 = 15 gnomes each.The last house has 20 - 15 = 5 gnomes.The total number of gnomes is 5 + 15 = 20.Thus, the answer is 5.The answer is 5.question: While walking across the room, Larry spotted a laser beam he wanted to study#

Let x be the number of gnomes in the fifth house. Let a be the number of gnomes in the first house and b the number of gnomes in the second house.Let c be the number of gnomes in the third house and d the number of gnomes in the fourth house.Then the total number of gnomes on the street is 20 and the total number of gnomes in the houses is 15 + 10 + 7 + 4 = 33.This equation makes 3 = 20 - 15 - 10 - 7 - 4, and hence x = 4.The answer is 4.#

Let G be the number of gnomes in the garden.G = 20 - 3 * 4 + G = 20 - 12 + G = 4 + GUsing the given information about the fifth house, G = 3.The answer is 3.question: Karl's uncle owns a toy company that makes#

Let x be the number of gnomes in the fifth house.Since there are 20 gnomes, the number of gnomes in the first four houses can be expressed as 4x.So the number of gnomes in the first four houses is the same as the total number of gnomes (20) on the street.Since there are 4x gnomes in the first four houses, there are 4 * 3 = 12 gnomes in the garden of each house.The fifth house has x gnomes, so there are 4 * 3 + x gnomes in the garden of that house.The remaining 12 + x gnomes are in the fifth house, so the total number of gnomes in the house is 12 + x.Let the number of gnomes in the house be y, so that 12 + x = y.Then 12 - x = y - 12 = -4, so x = 8 and y = 8.The answer is 8.question: Jorge and Sandra were at a Christmas party#

Let x be the number of gnomes on the fifth house. So 4(3) + 5x = 20.Distribute 3 to both sides: 8 + 5x = 20.Add 5 to both sides: 13 + 5x = 25.Divide both sides by 13: 13x = 23.Therefore, x = 23/13 = 1.The answer is 1.#

Let A be the number of gnomes at the fifth house.Then we know that there are 20 gnomes on the street.At the first house, there are 3 gnomes in the garden.So there are 3 + 3*4 = 11 gnomes on the first house.And we know that there are 20 gnomes on the street.So we have 3 + 4*11 + A = 20 gnomes on the street.Which simplifies to 20 = 3*(11 + A) - 3Therefore, A = 20 - 3 = 17 gnomes at the fifth house.The answer is 17.This was an awesome content.thank you for sharing.Your content is awesome.please continue#
