Let y be the number of pounds gained from berries, x be the number of pounds gained from small animals, a be the number of pounds gained from acorns.Then the gain from berries was y = 5/100 * 1000.The sum of all gains was x + y + a = 1000.The gain from acorns was 1000 - x - y.Thus, 1000 - x - y = 5 * 2 / 5 * 1000 = 10000 / 2 / 5 * 1000 = 2000 / 5 = 400.Equating variables produces x + y = 600 - 400 / 5.Combining terms with constants produces x + y - y / 5.We know the gain from acorns was 400, so the gain from small animals is 400 - y / 5.Integrating y gives y = 400 / 5 - 5 x + 360.We know y is the gain from berries, so 360 = y.Rewriting the equation, the answer is x = 180.Since we know#

First we need to find the number of pounds the bear needs to gain: 1000 / 5 = 200The number of pounds gained from berries is (200 x 2/5) + (200 x 1/5) = 40The number of pounds gained from small animals is 200/4The remaining weight the bear needs is 1000 - (40 x 2) = 200 Going back to the equation, we have 40 + 200/4 = 200. Therefore, the number of pounds the bear gained from eating small animals is 200.The answer is 200.question:#

1000 / 5 = 400 pounds.Then 400/15 = 256.So, at the end of summer, 256 pounds = 600 x 0.16 of the weight.So, the number of pounds = 400 - 256 = 144 pounds from small animals.Total: 256 + 144 = 400 pounds.The answer is 400.question:#

The expression is (0.2 * summer) + (0.3 * autumn) = 0.5 * 1000 = 500 pounds.Since 500 was a fifth of the total weight gained, the amount gained from berries was 100/200 = 0.5 * 1000 = 500 pounds.The correct answer is 25 pounds. In total, the bear gained 500 + 500 + 250 = 1000 pounds.#

In summer the bear gain 5 pounds a week which is 1000 รท 25 = 40.By fall she loses 15 pounds to hiberation so 1000 - 15 = 855.So, her summer gain is 20 less than her fall loss so she gains 355 minus 15 rounds out to 320 pounds.Since 1/5 of this is say 70 pounds, she must eat 70 animal pounds and Salmon weighs half of this so 120 pounds.So she ate 470 pounds in total so 1000 - 470 = 530.So the answer is 530.answer: Squirrels have 28 burrows.9 of the squir#

Let S be the number of pounds the bear gained from summer.W represents how many pounds the bear gained during the season of, let us say, berries. Then it gained S + W.750 was gained by eating berries so it must be multiplied by 5 to get the total amount gained from small animals.Then it will be (W + 2W + S) multiplied by 5.Therefore, it needs to eat a total of 5(W + 2W + S) pounds to gain 1000 pounds.Observing the terms of an equation having common denominators of the same product or sharing the same factor squared.From the given information, S =25.Thus, W + 2W + S = 500.The answer is 500. question 2: Vera was skiing at the Mass#

Let a be the amount of weight gained eating salmon, and a/5 will be the amount gained from the small animals.Add these two terms together on both sides of the equation to get (2+a/5)*500 + a*P = 1000 * (500 + P)The terms of 500 will cancel out, except for 5 left from the salmon, resulting in (5 + a/5)*1000 = 1000 * PNow, simplify to get 1000*a/50 = aNow, solve using standard addition and multiplication rules, to get a = 1000 * a/50 = 1000/50 = 20.Therefore, the number of pounds gained by eating small animals is a = 1000/50 = 20.The answer is 20.question:#

The weight gained by eating small  animals is 4500.After gaining 1000 pounds from berries, the bear devoured 5/5 * 1000 = 1000 stacks of acorns and half of the remaining 1000 pounds of berries from spring. That leaves the bear with 1000 * (6/5) = 3000 pounds it needs to gain to hibernate.Substituting 4500 into 3000 gives 4500 which is also the same as the original weights that the bear devoured while eating small animals from the forest.The answer is 4500.question:#

The weights were already in terms of pounds.Let x be the number of pounds gained from berries.Adding the five fifths due to berries and the two times more acorns gives 5 + 2 =7.Converting to a fraction results in 1/2 + 7/10 = 3/4.Several pounds were in salmon so 5 + 3/4 + 5 = 10.Therefore, the number of pounds gained from small animals was x = 62/10.The answer is 62/10.question:#
