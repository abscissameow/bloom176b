B = number of pounds of beef orderedC = number of pounds of chicken orderedAt $8 per B, this was 8B x B = 4B either.Then, at $3 per C this was 3C x C = 9CAccording to mathematical properties 2(ABC) = A + B + Cyielding 4B + 9C = 80 ; 9C = 48B/2.Substantiate on left side = 16B = 80 ; 24B = 88B + C = 88yielding B = 24 y C = 44The answer is 24 pounds of beef and 44 pounds of chicken.question:#

For beef, he bought 1000 pounds for $8 per pound, so he paid $8 * 1000 = $8,000.For chicken, he bought 2000 pounds for $3 per pound. So he paid $3 * 2000 pounds = $6,000.So the total cost of the beef and chicken was $8,000 + $6,000 = $14,000 questionFor any problem that usually involves fractions, you can convert to blocks if necessary.

John ordered 1000 pounds of beef.  1000 pounds is 200000 grams.  8 pounds is 1 kilogram so 1000 pounds is 200000 grams. 1 pounds = 453.592 grams.So then 200000 grams = 200000g / 453.592g = 500.513kg = 500kg.Now that we know 500 kilograms, we can calculate the beef cost. So 500kg x $8 = 4000$ total for beef.Next, we calculate the chicken cost. Since 200000g x $3 = 600$ total for chicken, so we multiply by two to get $3000$ total chicken.Because we know the beef cost, we can subtract the two together to get $4000 - 3000 = 1000$.  It took a total of $10000$ dollars to order 1000 pounds of beef and chicken.  The company isn't going to have a profit if the company spent more than what they made. That is#

The number of pounds of beef would be 1000 x 8 = 8000 pounds.The number of pounds of chicken is 800 x 3 = 2400 pounds.The 8000 + 2400 = 10000 pounds of beef and chicken.The number of pounds is 10000 x 0.75 = 7500 pounds.The amount $10,000.The answer is $10,000 question1: Which is larger, 20–8% or 7–20 %answer2: Cquestion3: When purchasing pens, how common is it for an individual to purchase 7 pens? question4: This series is 184,251, 183,248, 182,246, 181,245, 180,244.

The price of the chicken has been multiplied by 2 so 3x = $200.Multiply across to get x = $800.500 + $800 = $1500.Thus, the price of the beef was $1500.The answer is 1500.question:#

For beef he has 1000/8 = p.  pounds, and he spends $8 wabp.  So the beef cost = 8 × p.  pounds.  For the chicken he has 2p pounds for $3 per pound. So the cost of chicken is 6p × (3/2) pounds. Thus he spends 6(2p) pounds on chicken.  Thus the total cost for the food is 8p pounds for beef + 6(2p) pounds for chicken = 8p + 6(2p) pounds. The answer is 128 total pounds (approx 64.9 kilograms).  The answer is#

The quantity of beef was 1000 / 5000 = 0.2 pounds.The cost was 8 x 83.33 = $6,660.So, the total cost would be $6,660 + 6 x $2,300 = $12,960.question: Manny's puppy ate 5 of Keith's illustrations for his book, so she now has one example left in her book that she still needs to draw.  Emily's puppy ate 5 of Manny's illustrations, so one example is left. This is 0 + 1 = 2. Now, Manny's puppy ate 5 of Keith's remaining examples but he ate more than that.  Manny's puppy ate 90 pieces of illustrations, but Keith still has two examples left to draw so it is 90 - 2 = 88 illustrations.  Now, It is equal to 1 + 88 = 89 illustrations. Josh's puppy ate an example since he ate 10 of Manny's and Emily's illustrations.  Seeing that Josh ate all Manny's, Emily's, Keith's, and Josh#

Let C be the cost of the beef and let S be the cost of the chicken.We can add 1000 from beef and times it with our initial $8.Then, 800 * 8 gives 6400.Now to add with chicken and multiply it with our initial $3.Let's divide with 2 and multiply C with it.So, C * 3 = S / 2 + C x 20 / 2 = S * 12 / 10So, C = S * (12 / 10) = 4200.The answer is $4200.Carla divorced George after 30 years of marriage.

To figure out the price of beef, the value is 8 x 1000 pounds = 8000 pounds per 1000 pounds =.08 pounds per pound.The total cost is.08 x.08 =.004 pounds.Multiplying both sides by 1000 pounds gives 40 pounds.The total cost is 8000 pounds, which at $8 per pound gives a cost of $320 for the beef.For the chicken, the price is 0.3 x 3000 pounds = 1.3 pounds which is the weight of the chicken is 1.3 x 8 = 10.8 pounds.Divide 10.8 by 1000 pounds to get 0.108 pounds.The total cost is 3000 pounds x 8 pounds is $240.The total cost is $1920.question: In a survey of people who eat fast food, 10% of the people wanted to buy the large sized french fries and 90% wanted to buy either the small sized french fries or did not want any#

The only numbers that are related are 1000, $8 and $3. For the total cost, let's use the equation: 1000/(8+3)=592.8.dividing both sides by 8 produces 592/3=193.8.Again, divide by 8.  193/8=24.5.Round 24.5 to an integer so the answer is 24.The answer is 24.question#
