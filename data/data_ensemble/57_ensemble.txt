Let a be the number of kilograms used for chocolate chip cookies and let b be the number of kilograms used for peanut butter cookies. Then the remaining kilograms will be (10 - a - b). Carla used 1/5 kilograms of butter for the sugar cookies. Thus, the number of kilograms used for the sugar cookies is a + b + 1/5.The total amount of butter used will be b + a + b + 1/5 = 4 + a + 1/5.Thus, Carla used a = 6/5 kilograms of butter for the peanut butter cookies.Finally, she used ten minus the total of all the uses to find that there are 10 - (6/5 + 1/5 + 1) = 4/12 kilograms left.The answer is 4/12.#

X = 10 kilograms of butterLiza used 50 grams of butter for each group of chocolate chip cookies, then Liza used 100 grams of butter for each group of peanut butter cookies.Then she used 150 grams of butter for each group of sugar cookies.So, she used 50 + 100 + 150 = 300 kilograms for those 3 types of cookies.At the end, Liza had 300 - 150 - 50 = 150 kilograms of butter left.The answer is 150.question:#

Let x be the number of kilograms of butter still left.We know the number of kilograms of butter before the cookies were made: 10.We know the number of kg of stuff used for chocolate chip cookies: one-half of 10.We know the number of kg of stuff used for peanut butter cookies: one-fifth of 10.We know the number of kg of stuff used for sugar cookies: one-third of 8.We know how many kg of chocolate chip cookies were made: one-half of x.We know how many kg of peanut butter cookies were made: one-fifth of x.We know how many kg of sugar cookies were made: one-third of x.Thus, we have:10 + (x/2) + (x/5) + (x/3) = 8Combining constants produces: 15.5 + (x/5) + (x/3) = 8.10 + 15x/5 + 10 + 3x = 8.30 -2x = 8#

Let x denote the number of kilograms of butter that Liza still has who needs to make (x + 1) kilograms of cookies.  She's already made 1 kilo of butter for each kind of cookie.  So she made 1 + (1 x 5 / 3) + (1 x 2 / 2) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 more or 2 pounds of butter.Removing 10 kg of butter leaves her with only 2 kilos of butter.So x = 5 kilograms of butter.So there are 2 x = 10 kilograms of butter remaining.The answer is 10.question#

Let's number the cookies.Suppose we take 5 kilograms of butter while making peanut butter cookies.Now, she has 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30 kilograms of butter left.Therefore, there are 15 kilograms of butter left after making the pastries.Now 30 - 15 = 15.So, the number of kilograms of butter left remaining is 15.The answer is 15.problem : We can calculate operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication#

Liza put 10 kg of butter to make 3 types of cookies.The first type is half of the remaining butter which should be half of 10 kg = 10 kg * 25/100 = 2 kg butter.The second type is one-fifth of the remaining butter which should be one-fifth of 10 kg = 10 kg * 20/100 = 1 kg butter.The third type is one-third of the remaining butter which should be one-third of 10 kg = 10 kg * 9/100 = 3 kg butter.So, 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 kg butter is left to make cookies.PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN.PURA VIDA!PURA VIDA?THANKS!If you have any difficulty on the questions ask me that on my email.Here goes my email:Thanx!
First of all, have you solved it yourself?If so, have you checked your answers?Have you expressed the solution in terms of the answer as you were told to#

Sugar cookies use 3/10 extra butter.  So they're missing 9/10 of the butter used for peanut butter cookies.  Peanut butter uses 5/10 so it's missing 4/10 and chocolate use 2/5 so its missing 3/5.  9/10 - 4/10 leaves 1/5.  And since 3/10 = one half, the fraction is 3/5 so the remainder is 1/2.  1/5 + 1/2 = 2/3 and 2/3 packs left are 5/2 = 2kg of butter.  That means adding the two is 10 + 2 = 12.  10kg - 2kg left is 8 kilograms of butter leftover after making the three kinds of cookies.The last remaining 8 kilograms of butter are available for another batch of cookies. The answer is 12.#

After making 30 cookies, there would be 10 x 5/1 + 5 + 5/3 = 5 kilograms of butter left.Thus, the answer is 5 kilograms.question:#

Remember all parts must be divide by 5 for cookie ingredients.Chocolate chip cookies: 2 kilograms.Since they take 1/2 = 10/2 = 5 of the butter, 5/2 = 2 kilograms.Out of 10 kilograms of butter, we used 2 kilograms so we have 8 kilograms.Peanut butter cookies: 3 kilograms.Since they take 1/5 =.5 kilograms out of 10 kilograms of butter, we have 10.5 kilograms butter left.This is 8 + 10.5 = 18.5 so we have 2.5 kilograms remaining.Sugar cookies: 3 kilograms.Since they use 1/3 = 3.33 of 8 + 10.5, we have 8 + 10.5 + 3.33 = 23.33 kilograms butter.8 + 10.5 + 3.33 = 23.33 kilograms.8 + 10.5 + 3.33/0.05 = 94.33/4 = 22.11 kilogramsSince we have 22.11 kilograms butter, 1 kilogram butter is equal to 1/22.#
