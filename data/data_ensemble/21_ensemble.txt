Let x be the number of beetles that are eaten by each day.12 beetles are eaten per day by each bird and they eat x birds per day, giving 6x birds.In the same manner, 3 birds are eaten per day by each snake and they eat x snakes per day, giving 6x snakes.Snakes also eat 12 beetles per day, giving 12x beetles.6x + 6x + 12x = 6(6x) = 36xThen distribute 12 to 36x to give 36(12/x) = 108x12/x = 12, so x = 12.Therefore, 36(12/12) = 360 = x.36 times the number of birds eaten each day gives the number of beetles eaten each day.The answer is 360.question: Michael bought 3 cans of soda and an apple.

Let J be the number of jaguars, B be the number of beetles, and N be the number of beetles eaten. We want to find out the value of N.So, the number of birds eaten = 12J, the number of snakes eaten = 3J, and the number of beetles eaten = 5J.Since J is the same for all of them, we add together the birds and snakes eaten.Thus, 24J = N + 3J.Therefore, we have 24 + 3J = N + 3J.This is a simple equation and we distribute the 24 to the left side to get N = 12 + 6J.Now, we know that J = 6, and therefore the number of beetles eaten per day is 12 + 6 + 5 = 27.The answer is 27.question: Each ticket costs $2.50.

Let x be the number of beetles eaten per day.Let y be the number of birds eaten per day.Let z be the number of snakes eaten per day.Since a jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, we have 5z = z5Snakes are eaten by jaguars, which are eaten by birds, which are eaten by beetles.So, we can say that z5 + 3y + 12x = x12 + y3 + z5Combining like terms and substituting produces 12x + 3y + z5 = x12 + y3 + z5.Now we can distribute z5 to the other terms.So, we have 12x + 3y + z5 = 12x + 3y + z5 + z5.Now, substituting z5 for z we get 12x + 3y + z5 + z5 = 12x + 3y + z5 + z5 + z5.Now, combining like terms on the left side, we get 12x + 3y = 12x + 3y + z5 + z5.From the definition of y, we can see that y = 12x + 3y - z5 + z5 - z5 - z5 = - 12x - z5.From the definition of x, we can see that x = 12x - y + z5 + z5.Substitute x for z to get 12x - y +#

Let B be the number of beetles that are eaten by each bird every day. Let J be the number of beetles that are eaten by each jaguar every day. Let S be the number of beetles that are eaten by each snake every day.Then 12*B + 3J + 5S = the number of beetles that are eaten by all animals in the forest every day.Since 6J are eaten by the jaguars, there must be 3J = 2(6) beetles eaten by all the animals every day.There must be S = 2(J) = 12(6) = 72 beetles eaten by all the animals every day.Subtracting from B, we get B = S - (12*6) = 72 - (6*12) = 12.The answer is 12.question: Keira gave a nickel to a beggar#

Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.There are 6 birds and 12 beetles per day, so there are 72 beetles eaten by the birds.Each snake eats 3 birds per day.The number of snakes eating the birds is 6 times 3, which is 18.So, 18 birds are eaten by the snakes.Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.Since there are 6 jaguars, 30 snakes are eaten by the jaguars.Therefore, 18 + 30 = 48 birds are eaten by snakes and jaguars.In conclusion, 6(12) + 18(12) + 30(12) = 72 + 48 + 180 = 288 beetles are eaten by birds, snakes, and jaguars.The answer is 288.question: Harry baked 2 chocolate cakes. On the first day, his family ate#

Let x be the number of beetles eaten per day.There are 3 birds eating x beetles per day and 5 snakes eating x beetles per day, so 3x + 5x = 12.3x = 12 - 5x and 5x = 12 - 3x, so 3(x - 5) = 2.5(x - 3) = 2.Adding 5 and 3 to both sides, x = 9 and x = 6, therefore x = 7.The answer is 7.#

We will need to use a fraction to get the equation.The total number of beetles eaten each day is 3 birds per day x 5 snakes per day x 6 jaguars.So 3 x 5 x 6 = 180 beetles per day.Therefore, 180 x 12 = 2,160 beetles eaten each day.The answer is 2160.question: Will has 200 coins and#

Let A be the number of beetles eaten by all the animals.We know the total number of beetles eaten is 6 * 12 = 72.Because the birds eat 12 beetles each, the number of birds is A/12.Snakes eat 3 birds each, so the number of snakes is A/3.Jaguars eat 5 snakes each, so the number of jaguars is A/5.The number of beetles eaten by the birds is A/12 = 6.The number of beetles eaten by the snakes is A/3 = 12.The number of beetles eaten by the jaguars is A/5 = 18.Then the total number of beetles eaten is A/12 + A/3 + A/5 = A.Therefore, A = 72.The answer is 72.question: The cabbage heads of the Tustin family are arranged in a circular#

The number of beetles eaten by snakes is x/3. The number of snakes eaten by jaguars is x/5.question: Shaquille O'Ne#

There are 6 * 5 = 30 snakes.For each snake, there are 3 birds so the birds eaten are 30 * 3 = 90.Also, each bird eats 12 beetles so the number of birds eaten per day is 30 * 3 = 90.Each bird eats 12 beetles is 1080 + 90 = 1920 7 beetles.For every 7 beetles eaten, there are.Therefore, the total number of beetles eaten is 1920 + 90 = 2020 beetles.The answer is 1920.question: Raven can build a house in 28 days#
