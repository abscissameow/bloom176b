Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. Let S be the number of snowflake stamps.Let x be the number of truck stamps.Then the number of rose stamps is S + x - 9.Since there are 52 total stamps in Bella's stamps, we have x + S + 9 = 52.Therefore, S + x - 9 = 52.Combining constants on the left side gives 51 = x + S.Therefore, x + S = 52 - 9.Simplifying the left side gives x + S = 43.Since there are 11 snowflake stamps and 53 stamps in total, we have 11 + 43 = 54 stamps.Therefore, x = 42 and S = 53 - 42 = 11.The answer is 54.question#

Let x be the number of snowflake stamps.There are 11 x snowflake stamps.Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so there are 11 + 9 x truck stamps.She also bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so there are 13 x rose stamps.Therefore, the total number of stamps is (11 + 9x) + 13x = 11 + 9x + 13x = 11 + 9x + 13(x + 11)Since 11 + 9x + 13(x + 11) = 52, we can divide by 52 to get x + 11 / 52 = 1.This gives us x + 11 = 52 so x = 11 and the answer is 11.question: Ryan buys#

Let x be the number of truck stamps that Bella bought. So, she bought (x + 9) snowflake stamps.She bought x rose stamps and 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. The equation is 11 + (x + 9) + (x - 9) = 26.However, the number of truck stamps is unknown.The number of truck stamps is the solution to this equation.12x = 12 + 9 + (9 - 9) = 26.Therefore, x = 26 - 12 - 9 = 8.The answer is 26.question: Daria said she was going to post 9 bills to her friend, but she#

Let x be the number of snowflake stamps.So we have 11 x = 21 stamps.Therefore, 11 x = 2 (11 + 9).Since there are 2 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, it follows that 2 x = 9.Similarly, since there are 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, we get 13 x = -11.If we subtract 11 from both sides, we get - x = -12.The equation simplifies to x = -12 + 9 = 7.Then, 2 + 7 = 9.The answer is 9.question#

Let S be the number of snowflake stamps, T be the number of truck stamps, and R be the number of rose stamps.Then S + T + R = 11 + 9 + 13 = 30.Since S + 9 = T + 13, we know that S + 9 = T + 13.Therefore, the number of truck stamps must be 13.Then, we have 11 + 9 = 30, so 11 + 9 = 30.Thus the number of snowflake stamps is 11 + 9 = 20.The answer is 20.question: If Sam#

Let x be the number of snowflake stamps. And y be the number of truck stamps.Therefore, the number of truck stamps Bella bought is 11 + 9x.Since she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, she must have bought 13 - y more rose stamps than snowflake stamps.Thus, we have 11 + 9x = 13 - y.Combining like terms on the left side gives 8x = 13 - y.Then distribute 13 to 13 - y on the right side to get 13x = 13 - 9y.Now, rewrite the left side as 13x + y, so it becomes 13x = 13 - 9y.Since we know that 13 - 9 = 4, we can remove the + y and distribute 4 to the remaining term to get 13x = 13 + 4y.Transfer 4 to the right side to get 13 + 4 = 17.Thus, the number of snowflake stamps bought is 17.The answer is 17.question: Tia saved up $2.85 on her homework#

Let x be the total number of stamps bought. So we have 11 + 9x - 13y = 67.Adding - 13x + 9y = 67 - 13x = 54.Then distribute the 13 to both terms.So, we have 13x + 9y = 54.Multiplying both sides by 9 gives 9(13x + 9y) = 54 x 9.Rearranging terms gives 13(9x + 9y) = 54x.Distributing 13 on both sides gives 135x = 54x.Subtracting 135 on both sides gives 9x = 54 - 135 = -108.Therefore, the number of stamps bought in all is x = y = 33.The answer is 33.#

Let x be the number of truck stamps bought. Then we have the equation 11 + (9 + 13)x = 68.The first equation on the left is 11 + (9 + 13)x = 68.As 11 + 9 + 13 = 30, 11 + 9 = 20, and 11 + 13 = 24, we can move the constants across and solve for x.So we have (20 + 24)x = 68 and solving for x gives x = 32.Therefore, the number of truck stamps bought was 32.The answer is 32.question: Harry was having#

Let x be the number of snowflake stamps.Let y be the number of truck stamps.Let z be the number of rose stamps.Then, x + y = 11, so there are (x + 1) truck stamps and (y + 1) rose stamps.The number of truck stamps is x + 1.The number of snowflake stamps is (y + 1). The number of rose stamps is (y + 1) + 1.Therefore, the total number of stamps bought is x + y + (y + 1) + (y + 1) + 1 = (y + 1)(y + 2) + 1.The answer is (y + 1)(y + 2) + 1.question: Let a#
