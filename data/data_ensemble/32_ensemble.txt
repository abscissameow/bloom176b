Let t be the total distance traveled after the 3rd turn.Then, the total distance traveled must be 25 meters around the tunnel.So, the following equation would apply: t + 10 + 16 = 25.Since after the first turn the car traveled 5 meters, we have 10 + 16 = 25.Then transfer 5 from 25 to 10 and subtract 16 from 25 to get 10 - 16 = -5.Subtract 4 from -5 to get -1 and transfer the 1 from -5 to 10 so the equation becomes 10 - 4 = 6.Distributing the -4 into 6 results in 2 - 4 = -2.Therefore, the total distance traveled after the 3rd turn is 2 meters.The answer is 2.#

Let x be the number of meters it travelled after the third turn.After the third turn, it travelled a little further than x meters.After the third turn, it travels further than 4 x meters.After the third turn, it travels further than 8 x meters.After the third turn, it travels further than 16 x meters.After the third turn, it travels further than 23 x meters.x - 16 + 4 = 0, so x = 12.The answer is 12.question:#

The car had traveled (23 - 5 - 8) meters so it had traveled 18 meters after the 3rd turn.Remember that the 3rd turn is not included because it is immediately followed by the exit.The answer is 18 meters.question: There are 8 planets in the solar system. They are the#

This equation translates into the problem, as 23 = (5+8) + (a little further).Here, 8 is the distance traveled after the 2nd turn and 5 is the distance traveled after the 1st turn.Therefore, a little further is 8 + 5 = 13 meters.The answer is 13 meters.#

After the 3rd turn, the car traveled 23 meters around the ring plus 23 meters from the 3rd turn equals 46 meters.Then the total of the 3 turns is 46/5 = 9.8 meters, so the answer is 9.8.The answer is 9.8.question: Keith has a#

To figure out how far the car travelled, we need to look at the distance between turns and between turns and the exit.Now, each turn was 5 meters and the distance from the previous turn to the exit is 23 - (4 * 5) = 20.The distance travelled after the 3rd turn would be 23 + 8 = 31 meters.The answer is 31.question: Maggie is looking forward#

The total distance around the ring, d, is the sum of the distances travelled in the righthand turns plus the distance travelled after the 3rd turn.First, since there are a total of 4 right-hand turns, it must be the case that d = 4 (15) = 60 meters.Since the car has travelled a total of 23 meters around the ring, the distance travelled in the 3rd turn must be 23 - 60 = 17 meters.Since the distance travelled in each turn is in the form of 5 + 8, the expression 5 + 8 = 17 can be used to solve for the distance travelled in the 3rd turn. The distance travelled in the 3rd turn is 4 meters.Therefore, the distance travelled after the 3rd turn is the 3rd term and therefore is 4 meters.The answer is 4.question: Bernard and Jessica were playing a game that involved rolling dice. They rolled their dice until#

Let x be the number of meters the car has to travel after the 3rd turn.Then x + 5 + 8 + (x + 1) = 23.The expression x + 5 + 8 + (x + 1) = 23simplifies to 5 + (x + 8) = 23which means 5 + (x + 8) = 5 + x + 4x + 8 = 23.We can add 3x + 4x + 8 to both sides of the equation to get 5 + (3x + 4x + 8) = 23which reduces to 10x = 23.To solve for x, we have 23/10 = 2.The expression is simplified to 2 = 2x, so x = 11.The answer is 11.#

Let x be the distance traveled after the 3rd turn.There is a total of 23 meters around the ring.So the distance traveled after the 3rd turn is 23 + (4-1) + 5 + 8 + x.Then distributing the number 4 to 1 + 5 gives 23 + 4x = 23 + 12.Then distributing 12 to 4 and x gives 23 + 12x = 23 + 4x.Subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation gives 12x = -11.Simplifying 12x to 12 yields x = -11/12 = -2.Therefore the answer is -2 meters.The answer#

Let y be the number of meters that the car traveled from the 3rd turn.Then the distance from the 3rd turn is y + 4, and the distance of the tunnel is 23 - y.The 3rd turn is 4 meters after the tunnel, so 23 - y - 4 = 4.Then 23 - y - 4 - 4 = 4.Substituting y = 5 gives 23 - 8 - 4 - 4 = 4, so 5 = 4 - 8 - 4.Rearranging the equation produces (4 - 8) = 4 - 4, so (8 + 4) = 8.Solving the equation for y gives y = 4 - 4 = 0 meters.The answer is 0 meters.#
