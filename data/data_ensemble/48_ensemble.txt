Sam memorized 6 digits of pi more than Carlos. Carlos has 6 times as many digits of pi as Sam. Since Mina memorized 6 times as many digits of pi as Carlos, Mina has 6 * 6 = 36 digits of pi memorized.Sam memorized 6 digits of pi more than Carlos.Since Carlos memorized 36 digits of pi, 6 * 36 = 216.24 > 216 so Sam must have memorized 24 digits of pi.The answer is 24.To see this answer on#

Let S be the number of digits memorized by Sam.Then the number of digits memorized by Carlos would be C = 6*S.We know that Mina memorized 6 times as many digits as Carlos. This can be written 6*6 = 36*C.We know that Carlos and Sam memorized 6 more digits than Mina. So this can be written 6*S + 6*C = 36*C + 24.Then using this equation, we can substitute the S in the equation for C.6*S + 6*S = 36*C + 24 = 72*C + 24 = 7*S + 24 = 24*7*S.Simplifying produces 7*S = 112*S + 24.Then, S + 112*S = 24*7*S = 14*S = 14*24.But Sam memorized 6 digits more than Carlos. Thus we know that C + 6*S = 6*S + 6*C = 112*S + 24.We want the number of digits that Sam memorized, so subtract 6 from both sides to get 14*24 - 6 = 112*S + 24 - 6 = 112*S.Therefore, Sam memorized 112*S = 52 digits of pi.The answer is 52.question:#

Let x be the number of digits that Sam memorized.Then Carlos memorized (x/6) digits of pi.From the question, Mina memorized six times as many as Carlos so (x/6) * 6 = 6x.Thus, Carlos memorized 6x digits of pi.Carlos and Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos so it becomes 6x + 6 = 6x + 6x = 12xThus, Sam memorized 12x digits of pi.The answer is 24.#

Let x be the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized.Therefore, Sam would have memorized (x + 6) digits of pi.Combining the constants and rearranging produces 6x + 24 = 6x + 48 = 6x + 6x + 24.Simplifying the equation gives 6x + 24 = 48.Then, factor out 6 from 48, producing 48/6 = 8.Therefore, Sam memorized 8 more digits of pi than Carlos memorized.The answer is 8.question: There are four apples in a box and 12 pears. One of the apples#

Let x be the number of digits of pi Sam memorized. Then Carlos memorized x/6 digits.Mina memorized x x 6 = x*6 digits.The total number of digits is x + 6x + 6 = 6x + 6 + x + 6 = 3(x + 6) = 3x + 18.The answer is 24.question: What will be the result of#

We are given the equation:x = y + z thus x = y + z = 2x.Now, multiply the left side of the equation by 6 and by the right side.2x * 6 = x * 6 + z * 6 => 2x = 6x + 6z => 2x = 12.Therefore, Sam memorized x = 12 digits of pi.The answer is 12.question:#

The number of digits of pi memorized by Mina is 6 * 24 = 144 digits of pi.Carlos memorized 6 digits of pi. Therefore, Carlos memorized 6 / 144 = 5 / 144 = 4 / 144 digits of pi.Similarly, the number of digits of pi that Sam memorized is 6 / 144 = 5 / 144 = 4 / 144 digits of pi.question: Susan has $57 left to spend on candy. Half of the amount that she spent was on chocolate, and the other half was on lollipops. Candy costing an even dollar were on sale. How many lollipops did Susan buy?answer: Let x be the number of lollipops.Susan spent $57 on candy so that $57 / 2 = 28.#


 Tally the number of digits memorized by each boy.Sam: 6Carlos: 1Mina: 24Add 6 to all digits in each number.Number of digits in Sam's number: 6 + 1 + 24 = 31Number of digits in Carlos' number: 1 + 6 + 6 = 13Number of digits in Mina's number: 24 + 6 + 6 = 34Find the quotient of Sam's number divided by Carlos' number: 31/13 = 2Find the quotient of Mina's number divided by Sam's number: 34/31 = 2Sam's number is twice Carlos' number and Mina's number is twice Sam's number.Therefore, Carlos' number = Sam's number/2 = 13/2 = 6.Thus, the number of digits memorized by Sam is 6.The answer is 6.It can be used to add #

Let A be the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized. And let B be the number of digits that Sam memorized.Then B = 6A.Since Carlos memorized six digits of pi, we have 6A = 6.Therefore, Sam memorized 6 * 6 = 36 digits of pi.The answer is 36.question: Wendy had 6 crayons, Dusty had 8#

Let S and C be the number of digits of pi memorized by Sam and Carlos.Then 6S = 6(24) = 144 digits.Therefore, the number of digits memorized by Sam is S = 24.Thus, the number of digits memorized by Carlos is C = 24 * 6 / 6 = 12 digits.The answer is 12.question: The number of American World Series#
