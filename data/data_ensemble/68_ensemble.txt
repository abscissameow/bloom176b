Let X be the number of coins Amalie buys. Amalie has x + 450 coins.On top of it, Elsa has 10x coins.So, they both have (x + 450) + 10x = 440 coins.Equating and distributing in the left-hand side gives x + 10x = 440.The simplifies it to 4x = 440.Divide both sides by 4 to reduce the fraction to x = 9/10 = 90 coins.The total amount spent is 9/10 (90 + 50) = 45 coins.The answer is 45 coins.question:#

Let X be the number of coins remaining to Amalie.Then, 10*X + 45*(X + 1)  = 440  10 * X + 45 * 2 * X  = 440  2 * X + 45 = 440  X = 45Similarly, 3/4 of Amalie's money that was spent would be 45 * 3 / 4 = 75 coins.The answer is 45question: One thousand people can be divided into equal groups of 280 people with each group starting in a different city, or 1,280 people divided into groups of 105 people with each group starting in a different city. In how many vastly different ways can this be done?answer: Let A be the number#

Let A be the fraction of coins that Amalie has.Then, Elsa has more coins than Amalie so Elsa has (A + 1)/440unces of coins.Fraction 1/440 can be represented as (440 x 4/43)/(440 x 4/42).Multiply both the numerators and drop common exponents to give 440 x 4 = 1760.Therefore, Elsa has 1000 more coins than Amalie. Now Amalie has (A +1)/1000, or A + 990.If 3/4 of coins are spent on toys, Amalie will remain with (A + 990) x 3/4 = 1055 coins.The answer is 1055.#

Let x be the number of coins left with Luna, she spends 3/4*(x - 10) coins as she won't spend the coins she has. Thus 3x - 10 + 3/4*(x - 10) = 440. Therefore 3*x - 10 + 3/2*(x - 10) = 440. Combining like terms gives 3/2*x = 440 - 10. Divide both sides by 3/2 to obtain x = 8 coins. The answer is 8 coins.The answer is 8 coins.#

If the coins Elsa has is y, and the coins Amalie has is z, then the ratio is 10z:45y.So, the equation would be 10z:45y = 10:45. Algebraic Factoring gives 6.5y:45z = 10:45Equating constant and exponent gives y = z = 4.15 the number of coins Amalie has.So, the number of coins left with was 4.15 fourths of the originally 440 coins.The answer is 230.question:#

Elsa has 10 coins while Amalie has 10 coins. But since there are a total of 440 coins, the total number of coins they have is 45 + 10 = 65.Since Amalie spends 3/4 of the coins that she has and Elsa only spends 10 coins, we know that she spends 33/65 of the coins she has.We want to know how many she has so we need to figure out how many she spends. 33/65 is the same as 67/95 = 68/95 and we know she only spends 4x where x = number to be found.684 + 684 = 684 Ã— 2 = 1458 and 1458 is divided by 4 where x = 22.The answer is 64.question:#

Let x be the number of coins that Amalie has.Since Ella has ten times what Amalie has (10 x 45), x = 45 coins.Elsa spends 3/4 of what she has, which is 45/4 = 11 coins, and this goes towards 27 coins.There are still 440 coins remaining so the equation becomes 540/27 = x.Simplifying the equation gives x = 80 coins.The answer is 80.question:#

Let A be the number of coins that Elsa has. Let B be the number of coins Amalie has.Let X be the total number of coins they have.It is then that 10 A + 45 B = X.We then distribute 45 to B which is 10 A + 45 B = X. This is then simplified to 10 A + 45 B = X - B.We then transfer 45 from both sides. Now 10 A + 45 - 45 = X - 45 - 45 = X - 90This becomes (10 - 9) A = X - 90. For A = 25 the 24 is written as 240. Thus, (24/9) A is given a value of 30.Amalie therefore had 30 coins left after she spent 3/4. This is then 25 - 30 = 5 coins left.The answer is 5.question:#

Let x be the number of coins that Amalie has. Then the number of coins that Elsa has is 10x + 45x = 10 + 45x = 180 coins.         Elsa has 180 coins, and Amalie has 10x + 45x coins.She spends 3/4 of the coins, which amounts to (3/4)(10x + 45x) = (3/4)(180) = 90 coins.Therefore, Amalie spends 3/4 of the coins 90 coinsand will have 90 coins remaining.The answer is 90.question:#

Let E be the coins Elsa has.Let A be the coins Amalie has.Let D be the coins Amalie spent on toys.Then we have the relationship: E = 8 Surd 16 = D x A e -2 x A a -16 / 10 x A a / Sqrt 16 14It follows that A = E - D = 8 Surd 16 - 4 Surd 16 / 10 = 12 Surd 136 / 9 = 20 + 6 Sqrt 9 / Sqrt 136 / 9 = 40 / Sqrt 136 / 9 = (40 / 27) Sqrt 9 = 6 Surd 263 / 27 = 7 x 110 / 9 = 5 x 23 / 3Therefore A = 6 Surd 136 / 27 = 5 x 23 / 3Thus the number of coins that Amalie has at the end of her shopping would be 40 or 5 x 23 / 3.The answer is 5 x 23 / 3.question:#
