Let's call the amount of money she ended with S.Then 28 - 5/7 - 5/2 + S = 1Thus, 28 + 5/7 + 5/2 - S = 1.Subtracting 7S from both sides produces 21 + (5/2 + S) = 1.Divide both sides by 15.This gives 1/2 + S/10 = 1/5.Substitute S = 15 into the equation, and this results in S/10 = 2/5.Then, we can see that S = 2 because 10 + 2 = 20 and this equals 2 x 10.Thus, Leah lost only 1 dollar because the answer is 2/50.The answer is 1.question:#

Let x be the number of dollars Leah put in her wallet.Then if she paid 7 dollars on the milkshake, she had 28 - 7 = 21 dollars remaining.About half of 21 will be 10 so -10 is half of 21 dollars.This means she spent 10 10ths of 1 dollar.On the other side, 10 tenth of 1 dollar + 1 average dollar = x dollars. 10 x + $1.10 x + 10 x = 10 + 10 = 21.Solve for x which gives 2 x = 10.Therefore, she lost 10 dollars.The answer is 10.question#

Let L be the amount of money she lost.If the money in lost in the neighborhood, so L = 28 - (7000 / 7) = 12000 / 7 - 28 = 1600 / 7 = 220 / 7 = 28.Attending to 7s, we have 27 / 7 = 3Another 7 gives 7 - 3 = 4 which gives 3, 4 so, 7 + 4 = 11, but her remaining money in the wallet is 32, and thus, we have 11 -7 = 4, so the amount she lost in dollars L = 4, - 81 cents.Candy Math Questionsmath.stackexchange.com/questions/822115/multiply-and-box-the-new-24-questions?r=srpsrt Volume:math.stackexchange.com/questions/822391/how-to-calculate-centimeters-to-pounds?hyqqm project of Google to allow users to pitch their own algebraic Eine Eigenschaft varyiert nicht zufalls weise accesible.step.1 CombinationMath Can do anything, which general math programs math for artistsGoogle is in dating, and#

The amount of money spent on the milkshake is a seventh so (3x7) - 1.Since half of the rest was put in savings so the number of dollars Deah" wallet were (50s V) + 1.Then the number of eggs she deposited was (28s C) - 1.Her dog got ahold of her wallet and yanked it so her dog ate (28s E) eggs.1 + (28 E) = 1 because her dog ate 1 dollar.It produces 116 C + 28 V + 28 E = 28 + 1This equation is a system of equations that solves to C = 4, V = 8, E = 20.The answer is 32.#

Leah’s wallet has a total of 110 dollars: 28 dollars + half of the remaining dollars spent in savings + the dollar retrieved,,, or28 + (1/2(x - 52)) + (1 + 52)) = 1108 + (1/2(482)) + (1 + 52) = 1103 + 24 = 1105a) 1/2(482)) + (1 + 52) = "x-"b) 1/2(482)) + 24 = "x-"c)(x - 52) + (1 + 52) = "0+"

Let S₁ be the amount in her wallet before the dog got hold of it.Thus, S₁ = 28 - (7 + 12 + 3 + 3) = 7 dollars. (Because the dog ran off $7 and half of S₁ or $7/2 went in her savings account).S₁ = 7^x%91 = 7.69%x = (27.69) = 2So the amount in her wallet before the dog got hold of it was 7^2 = 49 dollars.Therefore, the number of dollars Leah lost was 49 - 1 = 48 dollarsThe answer is 48.#

Let x be the number of dollars that Leah lost.  Then $28 - x = 1.Taking out a seventh gives $7 - x = 1.Multiplying both sides by 7 gives 7 * 7 * 7 - x = 1By dividing, 7 * 2 * 2 - x = 1 or 7 * 2 - x = 3.Therefore, the number of dollars lost by Leah is x = 52.The answer is 52.These are all the quiz questions with detailed explanations from the online#

Let D be the number of dollars Leah lost. So 28 = 7D + 5 + D / 2 + D / 7.Since she still has 1 dollar there should be 37 dollars total. But she lost 26 dollars that must get subtracted.So, 37 - 26 = 11.This translates to D = 11 - (5 + D / 2) = 11 - 4 + D / 2.8-4 = 5 and 5 + D / 2 can be re-written as 5 + D / 4.Then, we 8D = 11 - 5 + D / 4.Distribute 8D over 1b so it becomes 8/8 = 1 - D + 4D / 4.Then, combine the like quantities, and there is 1 - D + 4D / 4 = 3 - D + D / 4.Then transfer 4D / 4 back to the left side and there is 1 + 3D = 11.Therefore, D = 6.The answer is 6.question:#

Let x be the number of dollars that Leah lost.Leah lost 0.7 * 28 = 17 in the form of sh$7 $$→ 22 − x = 17 + 0.5x = 17 + 5 = 22. Therefore x = 21.Her wording says left. If she left $1 it means she lost 21 - 1 = 20 silverback photography dollars.Thus, the answer is 20.Question 115 (20 points)question:#

Leah has 28 + 14 + 14 = 52 dollars.She spent 7/10 of it, so the equation is (52 – 7)/10 = 14, which equals 2 dollars.The number of pieces is therefore 14 + 13 + 12 = 41 pieces and the piece of all of them is missing out.Therefore the equation should be 46 – 41 = 5.The missing dollar is $5 so she loses 5 dollars.question: According to the topographical map, Tom finds the shortest distance between Camden and Kitty Hawk in 26 miles.
