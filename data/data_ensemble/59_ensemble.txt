Let C be the number of coins.30C + 35C + 50C = 15C + 50C = 75Coins.Then, subtracting them produces 30C + 35C + 50C - 15C - 15C = 20C - 15C = 5C45C = 15C + 50C + 5C - 15C - 15C = 20C - 15C = 5C15C -15C = 0Therefore, C = 3 coins.The answer is 3 coins.#

Let x be the number of coins collected.We have x = 15 + 20 +40 + 50 = 95 coins collected.Note that in the fourth hour, 45 coins were collected. In the fourth hour 50 coins were given to Jack so we can say that 15 coins were given away. Thus, in the fourth hour 45 - 15 = 30 coins were left.Then a total of 45 + 30 after 4 hours results in a total of 75 coins after the hour.Then 195 x 75/100 = 1520 coins were given to Jack.Thus, Bob had 1520 - 15 = 1500 coins left.The answer is 1500.question:#

Let x be the number of coins collected during the first hour  Then (x + 35 + 50) - 15 = 85.Note that she collected 15 coins during the first hour, that is x = 15.Then the equation above reduces to (x + 35) = 115.Or the sum of 3 hours is 115 coins.Let's distribute 40, for the total number of hours, to both the sides of the equation x + 35 + 50. So it becomes 40 * x = 875.Now put 880 in the place of 40. Thus the equation becomes 880 * x = 880 + 880 = 1760. Distributing 40 again especially to x makes (40 * -2) digits of x = -540.Subtract 740 from both sides and the remaining equation is 900 - 740 = 160 x.Solve for x so, 600 - 160 = 400 x.Therefore, x = 200/-/ = 2 0/-/-.Her remaining coins is x = 15 + 35 + 30 + B#

x would be the number of coins collected by Joanne.So, Joanne collected 15 + 35 + 35 = 70 coins from the fountain.In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins and 5 coins were given to the cashier for a soda so she had 65 coins after handing over the coins to the cashier.Therefore, the number of coins is 70 - 65 = 5 after the fourth hour.Thus, Joanne has five coins after the fourth hour.The answer is 5.#

We can represent all the coins as a fraction: C*100/H + H*C/H / H where C is the number of coins with an hour remaining, H is the total number of coins in the fountain, and C and H are integers.Let's try and solve this. We know that we have 15 coins so we have 1*100/15 + 15/100/H. In order for this to represent all of the coins, we must have H = 15. So the answer would be 15.#

For 45 minutes, she collected 68 coins. Therefore, she collected 46 coins per hour. Therefore, the final number will be 46 x 4 = 172.The answer is 172.question:#

Let x be the number of coins Joanne had after the second hour.So, the number of coins following the 1 st hour would be the number of coins following the second hour + 15 coins.Rearranging terms yields follows: 15 + x = 35.Distributing 35 onto 15 and x yields 35/15 + 35x = 35.Then transfer 35 from the left to the right side: 15 + 35x = 35.30/15 = 3/5.Therefore, the number of coins Joanne had following the second hour is 35x3/5 = 15 coins.Therefore, the number of coins after the fourth hour is 35 + x = 15 + 35x3/5 + 15 = 15 + 15 + 15 = 45 coins.The answer is 45.question:#

The rule is to accumulate by hours which we can do with 15 + 35 x 2 = 70 coins and 50 + 15 x 4 = 60 coins.subtracting the coins kept for coffee, we get 70 - 15 = 55 and 60 - 15 = 45as needed, in 4 hours of collecting and giving away, 15 coins were kept for coffee making a total of 55 + 45 = 90coinsThe answer is 90.question:#

Let total_hours represent the hour.First hour, 1 = 15 coins.Starting second hour, 2 + 1 = 3Since Joanne collected 35 coins in second hour, the equation becomes 35 = 15 + (3 - 1).But Joanne already collected 15 coins in the first hour, so 7 coins remained to be collected in the second hour.So, the equation becomes 35 = 7 + (3 - 1).Similarly, for third hour, the equation 35 = 7 + (3 - 1) is repeated.And for the fourth hour, 35 = 7 + (4 - 1).Therefore, the value of fourth hour that the fountain collected is 4 = 50 coins.Then the coin that Joanne has left is 15 coins.The answer is 15.question:#

Joanne collected 15 coins during the first hour so the expression is 1*15 coins. Joanne collected 35 coins from the 2-hour fountain so 2x = 35 coins. Multiply the second hour 2x by 2 to get the total coins. The expression becomes 2x*2 = 35. Joanne collected 50 coins during the fourth hour, so 4x = 50 coins. Subtract the coins given away so 4x = 50 - 15 = 35 coins. The answer is 35 coins. NEXT PAGE >
