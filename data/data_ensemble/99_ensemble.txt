Because of the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, one of the first tank fish eats another will increase the number of fish in the first tank and decrease the number of fish in the second tank.We have 2(48 ÷ 2) + 3(48 ÷ 3) = 48 ÷ 2 + 48 ÷ 3 + 2 + 38 = 2.Since 2(48 ÷ 2) = 2, then 2(48 ÷ 2) + 38 = 2(48 ÷ 2) + 3(48 ÷ 3) = 48 ÷ 2 + 48 ÷ 3 + 2 + 38 = 48 ÷ 4 + 48 ÷ 12 + 2 + 38 = 2. Therefore, we have 2(48 ÷ 2) + 3(48 ÷ 3) = 48 ÷ 2 + 48 ÷ 3 + 2 + 38 = 2.The answer is 2.question:#

48 - x - 2x = 24.As follows, (48 - x) + 2x = 48. So 48/48+2x = 1.We can alternate adding and subtracting 2x, and change the order of the coefficients in the two sides.2x^2-2/lamda^2+2 -2=0In the set of equations, lambda^2+4=lamda^2-2; lamda^2-2 = 2+lamda^2-4 lamda^2 = 12 +3 lamda^2 = 15 lamda = 9 <wraprupalank="1"textwrap="0"mailto="">HOLES IN SPEAK, ROW 36 AND 13.</textwrap></rpsrp>  FOUR CARDS to deal away because that's how many are left over.

Let A be the number of fish in the second tank.  Then the number of fish in the first tank would be 4 + 3A.That is since each fish tank has 4x fish and the second tank is twice the size of the first tank thus you would have 2x more fish in the first tank says and the total number of fish would be 4x + 3(2x) = 4 + 12 = 3 x 2 fish.The first tank fish eat 2x fish so the water reduces by 2x. So there are 3 x–2 x=2x + 3x fish remaining in the first tank.The answer is 6 fish.question:#

Let  L represent the capacity in gallons of the larger tank and  l represent the capacity of the smaller tank.So, the size of the larger tank is  2L = 48 gallons while the smaller tank shrinks to   1 / 2 *l = 1 / 2 *24 = 12 gallons and it has 48 - 12 = 36 empty gallons.Assuming that there are   x inches of fish, there are x gallons of water added to each tank.Adding L and 2l and canceling  L+2l = 2L+2l = 2( 48 ) + 2( 12 ) = 100 Therefore, the solution is to add 2x = 2 gallons of water to each tank.Thus, the final solution is to add 0 inches of fish to the first tank and 2 inches of fish to each 40 gallon tank of water.The answer is 20.question:#

Let F be the number (i.e., F - fish) of fish in the first tank.  Then twoF = 48 + 48/2F := 48 + 24 = 242Fan F -  F - 1Eight fish two inches long aka 48/16 = 24/16 fish one inch long are in the first tank. We calculate the remaining size of the first tank. Two inches < 64/2 = 32/2 gallonsThus, the remaining water in the first tank is 24 + 32/2 = 36 gallons.The solution is 352 divided by 16.Because the unit is gallons.The answer is 16.question:#

Let a be the number of fish in the first tank and let b be the number of fish in the second one and c be the number of fish in the first tank that eats another fish.First, there are 48 x 2 = 96 gallons of water in the tank that is "2x" the size of the second tank.The tank that is twice the size of the other tank has doubles of each fish so 2 x 3-inches + 3 x 2-inches = 12 + 6 = 18 fish.Therefore, first tank has 18 fish and the second tank has 12 fish.The negative of the first term would be angled to the left so 12 - 18 = -6Therefore, the number of fish eaten in the first tank by a fish in the first tank is -6.Thus the equation becomes -6 x 12 = 12 - 6 = 6 fish are in the first tank.The answer is 6. question description: This question is to help you practice determining the antiderivates of#

The first tank has double the fish as the second tank.According to Gail’s rule, the first tank has two x 2 = 4 lower inches than the second tank.Suppose a fish from the first tank eats another, then that will give a lower inch of fish to the total fish in that tank.If a two-inch fish eats a three-inch fish, then the third inch will give a lower inch than each inch of the two remaining fish which gives a total of three lower inches, as follows:- 1 3 2 3 ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow }The answer is 3.question:#

Let x be the number of fish that ate another fish.If Gall keeps two animals in the first tank and three in the second tank, there are 26 more animals in the first tank. Thus, it must be 48 - 2 * x - 3 * x = 26 and therefore 2x - 3x = 26 - 24 = 2.Now, the expression is 2x = 9 and 2x - 3x = 2Subtract 3x from both sides to have 2x - 3x = 5x or 5x = 2 subtract one to have x = 1.Substitute for x from the previous step to have 6x = 26 - 24 and multiplying 6 by 1 gives 6 fishes that ate and therefore there are 1 fish in the second tank.The answer is 1.#

Let X be the number of fish in the first tank.Then there are 2x fish in the second tank.The first tank is twice the size of the second tank so the first tank has x * 2 inches of fish.The rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish gets us 1 gallon = x liters of fish.Which means 1 gallon + 1 ton = PI:KEY feet + 1 piece = 231.5 feet.Because the second tank has 48 gallons of water, this means the first tank has 48 + X liters of fish. So the equation becomes PI:KEY liters + X = 231.5 liters.bringing everything to one side we have x = 231.5 / 48. Then we have 231.5 / 48 = 5 liters.bringing to one side we have 231.5 = 5 x 48.Which leads us to have 231.5 = 5 x 48 and the following, 231.5 / 5 = 48.Thus we have 231.5 = 48 x 48.8 x 48 = 384.Round#

Let W1 be the number of fish in the first tank and W2 be the number of fish in the second tank.In order to keep one gallon of water for each inch of fish, the equation is W1 x 1 + W2 2 = 2W2 3So W1 + 2W1 3 = 2W1 3Rearranging gives 8 x W1 + 27W3 = 2W1 3This gives 27W1 x W2 = 2W1 3Multiplying W1 x 27 on the right side gives 27 x W2 = 2W1 3Multiplying both sides by W2 gives 270W1 + 2W1 3 = 2W1 3Solving for W1, we have 270 W1 + 2W1 3 = 2 W1 3Clearing the parentheses gives 270 W1 + 3W1 3 = 2W1 3Multiplying by 27 gives 630W1 = 2W1 3Similarly, dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives 15W1 = 2W1 3Adding W3 to both sides gives 15W1 - 3W1 3 = 2W1 4So the number of fish is 15 W1 and the number of fish the first tank has is 15 // his tank would have 3W1 worth#
