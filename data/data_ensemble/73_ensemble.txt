Let n be the number of packs of trail mix Roger purchases.So, there will be 13 * n kids, and 3 * n coaches, and 2 * n helpers.Thus n(13 + 3 + 2) = 72, which can be rewritten as 72 / 13 = 13 * n. From here, you can solve for n to obtain 72 / 13 = n = (72 / 13) * 12 = n / 12packs of trail mix.The answer is 6 packs of trail mix.question:#

Let x be the number of pouches Roger needs to buy.There are 13 + 3 + 2 = 17 full-stacked players.There are 13-17 = 2 spare players.Finding the number of spare players multiply the number of players by 6 gives 6x.Clearly, there are 2 spare players so 2x = 24 pouches.Therefore, we have x = 24 ÷ 6 = 4 thus the number of pouches Roger will need to buy is 4 packs of 6 pouches.The answer is x = 4.question:#

Let x be the number of packs.In order to ensure none of the players got left out, we can assume there are as many packs as there are players plus coaches, so there are 13 + 3 + 2 = 17 x on hand.Since the number of packs was 13 + x, we can think about the number of pouches as 17 + (13 + x) = 52 filled pouches.So we can count the empty pouches, such as 52 - x =?To solve this, we can multiply 52 by 6, which produces 312 pouches, and subtract each of the values from 312, so there are 52 - 6 = 46 empty pouches.And there are also 52 - 8 = 44 pouches with remaining trail mix.Therefore, x must be 52 / 6 - 6 / 45 to fulfill everyone’s pouches.The final answer is therefore x = 52 / 6 - 6 / 45 = - 1 pouch.The answer is - 1 pou#

Let x be the number of pouches purchased. So we'll need at least 13 pouches for the athletes. After that, assume there are only 13 pouches for all of the team because players get a break. That would only need 1 pack for the helpers, 2 for the coaches, and 3 for the helpers.So we get the expression 13x + 1 = 15(6 packs for 6 players plus two coaches) we're given that: 13 x + 1 = 15 6x + 1 = 2The expression simplifies to: 4x = 2Find x. For convenience, we change the denominator to x. (Squaring both sides does not work in this problem.)To solve the equation, we perform long division. The equation then becomes 4x = 2x x = 2/4 The value of x is 1/2. Let's substitute x in the second part of the equation. (However, we shall leave the expression#

We can view this as an addition problem. Each person has an apples and we have a total of 15 apples.Each person has 6 pouches of trail mix. Each pouch has 6–6+5 = 13 pouches of trail mix.Each person has 6+i extra pouches of trail mix. If a person has 13 person on his baseball team, plus 3 coaches + 2 helpers that would be 13 + 3 + 2 = 18 total people. The extra pouches will be (18–6) + 6 = 12 extra pouches of trail mix.So we can turn this into an addition problem. Add 6 + i extra pouches of trail mix for each 13 i people.The answer is 1+12+13+14+15+16+17+18 = 134. Then we get#

Roger has a total of 19 people to feed.6 packs of trail mix contains 36 packs of pouches.Thus, he runs short by 10:19 (36 - 16).So, he should buy 17 more packs of trail mix.The answer is 17.question:#

Let r be the number of trail mixes the team gets.Then there are r * 6 = 6(r) pouches. Thus the equation is 13 + 3 + 2 = 6r.This procedure was done in the book and was read.He goes through 13 + 3 + 2 = 10r first, so he got 10r (which the right side was divided by 2) and then did 13 + 3 + 2 = 6r from that equation earlier.There are 10 "r"s so 10/r is.01 and since.01 is less than 1, the numerator is expanded.So there are 10 x.1 + 0 which gives him.1100, as in the book.Thus r = 10x + 1, where x is some real number.Now, there are 10x + 1 *.5 = 5, since fractions can be added over integers.The denominator is converted into what the denominator is in the book by multiplying the fraction by 5.So it becomes 10#

Let x be the number of packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy for the whole baseball team.The number of base coaches and helpers is 2 so we know that it is a multiple of 3.64 / 6 = x / 6 = xThen 13 + 2 + 3 = 15 / 3 = 5.x / 6 = x / 2 or  6x / 3x / 6 = 2x / 2xSo 6x = 9 or  x = 3.The answer is x = 3.#

Base case: There are 13 people and they combined would amount to 13 * 6 = 78 pouches. To account for the 3 coaches and 2 helpers, 78 * 5 = 390 pouches.question: In October, there were 173 new phones purchased at Hicks-TV. The sales pitch of the new phone was estimated at a monthly market share of 20%. In November, the monthly market share was reported as only 14%. What is the difference between the new phones in October and the new phones in November?answer: Let And the new phones in November will be x = 210 - 173, which is u = 37 phones.Compare u and the number of newer phones in November: 37 < 210 -#

Let M be the number of meals needed for the snack.The number of helpers, coaches and members of the baseball team together makes 15 people.Then one pack of trail mix satisfies 6 people so the trail mix provides 15 packs.Then, M = 15 packs of 6 = 90 meals.So M = 90 meals gives M = 6 packs of 15 = 90 meals.The answer is 6 packs.question:#
