Let the number of quarters be x.Then, the number of nickels would be 20/4 = 5 times the number of nickels.The expression 5- 3x represents the total value of the nickels.There are 3x iron nickels and + to no obtain a total of $3* 3x.Solving for x gives 3x = + 3.Subtracting 3 gives x = 3.So there would be 3x = 3 iron nickels and the value of the total.The value of the total is $3*3 = 9 iron nickel.The answer is 9.question:#

We know that Alice had 20:1=4coins. So that is 100 cents (20 quarters + 1 nickel). Add 20% to that to get 112 cents. Now we need to convert all those cents back to Nickels. 112 cents = 11 x 100.00 = 1100.00. Thus 1100 Nickels + 11% Iron Nickels = 1200.Rounding up gives $1220.00The answer is 1220.analyzescientific wayfindingChinese language systemChinese KanjiChinese charactersChinese#

Let y be the value of all her money together.Then she has 20 quarters, y/4 = 150 total dollars.She also has all the nickels which are worth y/n = 150/3 = 50 dollars.And the iron nickels are going to be worth 3y/20 = 75 dollars.The total value of her money is y = 450 dollars.The answer is 450.question:#

Let x be the number of quarters that Alice has.We need to find the value of the nickels, so we need to find x*3. We know the total is $2.2 + x*3 = 10 + x.Divide by x on both sides to get 10/x = 2.Solve for x to get x = 5.Therefore, the total value of her coins is 20*20 = 400.The coin worth $3 each is 40 nickels so the total value is 400 x 5 = 1000.The answer is 1000.question:#

Let x be the total value of the nickels that Alice gets back from the bank.So on the silver nickels, the value is 20 x (1 - 3x/100) = 20 x 2.1625 or $4 * 1.1625 = 5.65So, we have 20 * 5.65 = $110.The answer is $110.

Let b be the number of iron nickels and p be the number of pennies.Then 53p = 20b + 73cNow, we know there are 0.2 iron nickels per nickel. So 20b = 0.2(20c).The iron nickels are worth 3 each. So 0.2(20c) = 6 + 3b.Add the number of pennies to both sides and we get 53b + 73 + 20b + 8p = 20.Now we need to solve for b, but 20c can't be a whole number. So break up 20b and 42 = 11 + 9b.53 = 9.2 + 7.8Now 9.2 = 0.11 * 20cWhich is 11c. That leaves 7.8 = 59.2p = 59.2 / 0.15 which is 0.4*20c or 0.8*20c. The result is the following:59.2p / 0.15 =/11/2019c which is 4c.The answer is 6.The answer#

Let t be the number of nickels in the iron set, and n be the total number of nickels. So, 40% of the nickels are iron nickels.Carla moved t + n nickels to the iron set and 20t nickels to the regular set.S' = t + n = 40t + 20tn.S'/S = 20tn/40t = 12/5 = 2t/4n = 20t.T = 12t + 4n.The total value of Alice's money is 20t + n = 12t + 12n.Mirror Work In the magical mirror after Save Your Neck Mirror work in one of the most detailed scenes manually changed into a defense and an attack, giving players a chance to win surprises.

Alice has 20 quarters before going to the bank.Let these quarters plus the value of the nickels be represented by  VI. So the equation we are after is then then 20 / 100 = x / 4.40 / 1000 = x / 4.1000 x / 2500 = 4000 x / 5000.The quarters are ignored so the equation becomes x / 4 = 1000/4. x = 250 quarters.After going to the bank the equation, 20 / 100 = x / 4 must be after the nickels changed.Therefore, the new number of quarters, since 20 was ignored, is now 20 = 250 quarters.Therefore, Alice now has 250 Ã— 4 = 1000 quarters.Thus, her total worth in nickels would be VI would be x = 4000 x /5000.The answer is 1650.question:#

Alice has 20 quarters. She wants to exchange them for nickels so there will be 3 times more nickels than quarters or 20 nickels = 60 quarters. Let x be a quarter, so she has 20x quarters.Let y be a nickel, so she has 3y nickels.By the process of elimination, her nickels are 20.20 x 3 = 60, so dividend 3 x 3 = 9.20 : 9 = 2 = 3 - dividing 20 into 6 (9 : 6).So three times more are nickels than their own value after exchange because 3 x 3 = 9.20 : 3 = 6 : 4 = 2 - dividing 20 into 6 (6:2).Therefore, the total value of her money is 53.91.The answer is 53.91#

20% of the nickels are worth 3 each.Let T be the total value of her money,  x the number of nickels she has, y the number of iron nickels she has.So:20 x + 3x + y = 8320 x + 3(x + y/2) = 833x + 2/3 y = 8Thus, y = 2 and x = 81 - 2 = 79.Therefore the total value of her money is 20 x + 3x + y = 20 - 79 = 1 dollar and 1 nickel.The answer is $1.01.question:#
