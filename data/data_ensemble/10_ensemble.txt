In the first hundred years, a ship had 2x people.A new ship would have 2x people compared to the previous ship.So each ship would have 2x times 100 years = 200 people.Over the three hundred years, there have been 300 ships.So 847/200 = 37 ships.The number of people on the ship the monster ate is 47 because it ate one ship over the three hundred years.Thus, the number of people on the first ship was 47.The answer is 47.question:#

The first ship to be attacked has n people on it.Let n^2 be the number of people on a ship in the second hundred years and n^3 be the number of people on a ship in the third hundred years.The monster ate a total of 847 + (n^2 + n^3) = 847 + 2(n^2) people.Simplifying by factoring out 847 gives 2(n^2) = 847 + n^3.Since each ship after the first one had two more people on it, we know that each ship had n + 2 people.Subtracting 2 from both sides gives n^2 = 847.Divide both sides by 847 to get n = 37 people.Therefore, there were 37 people on the ship that was eaten in the first hundred years.The answer is 37.question: Alice is playing her favorite game of bingo and has purchased a total of#

In the first hundred years, a ship had 2x people.A new ship would have 2x people compared to the last ship.And the monster consumed 2x + 1 people compared to the last ship.Let a be the number of ships so 3x = 300.Then, it is 300/3 = 100.So a = 100.The number of people on each ship is 2x.Hence, there were 100*2x = 200 people on the first ship.Therefore, 200*2 = 400.Thus the monster ate 847 - 400 = 447 people.The answer is 447.question: Larry traveled into the wilderness#

Let x be the number of people on the first ship. Then 2x is the number of people on each of the remaining ships.By 300 years, the number of people consumed would be 2*(300 * x) = 900 * x.Combining like terms and solving for x gives x = 900 / 847.The answer is x = 100 people.question: The family had a house inspection and#

Let x be the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years.Then, there are x + 847 people who lived for the next 100 years.Adding all the years together gives us 3 x + 847 = 1907 + 847.The common denominator will be 1907 + 847.Taking out the same common denominator on both sides gives 892 = x + 100.Rearranging, we get 991 = 2 * x.Finally, factoring 991, we get x = 490 people.The answer is 490.question: If a yard is 36.3 feet#

Let the number of people on the ship be x.The monster ate x people in the first 100 years, so the first 100 ships would have been x + 2(x) people.Over the next 200 years, there would have been (x + 2(x)) * 2(x + 1) people.Then for the last 100 years, there would have been (x + 2(x)) * 2(x + 1) people for the last 100 ships.The total number of people is sum of all the ships is thus 2(x + 1) * 3(x + 1) - (x + 2(x)) = 847.Solving for x produces x = 847 / (2(x + 1) * 3(x + 1)) = 847 / 3,486 = 4 people.The answer is 4.question: Dozens of curious zombies have#


Let x be the number of people on the ship.If each ship has twice as many people as the previous ship, then 2 * x = y, where y is the number of people on the second ship.Divide both sides by 2 to get x = y/2.If y = 847, then x = 847 / 2 = 377 people.The first ship had 377 people.The answer is 377.question: For the next 20 days, put in an envelope one dollar per day.#

The number of people on a ship is y. In the first 100 years, there were 1x = y people on a ship. And for every 100 years, the number of people on a ship will double. So, 2x = y for every 100 years.Putting the 2 in front of x gives the number of people on the ship in the first 100 years to be x * 2 = y * 2.Simplifying the equation, 2x = y * 2 gives 2y = 200.Then, 2y = 200 and dividing each side by 2 gives y = 100 people on a ship in the first 100 years.The answer is 100.question: Daniel likes his birthday on the 29#

Let m be the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years. Thus the number of people the monster ate in the first hundred years is m + 847 people.Let n be the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the second hundred years. Thus the number of people the monster ate in the second hundred years is m + 847 people.As the ship size doubles in size over time, the number of people on the ship that the monster ate is given by 2m + 847. This is true because the number of people on the ship the monster ate the second time is twice the number of people it ate the first time.From this, we get 1 + 847 = 2m + 847, or 847 = 2m + 1.Dividing both sides by 2 and simplifying produces 847 = 2m.Combining the two identical expressions gives 847 = m. Thus m = 847/1 people.The answer is 847/1 people.question: Alexa,#


et x be the number of people in the first ship. Then 2x would be the number of people in the second ship and 2x + 1 would be the number of people in the third ship.So, 3x + 2(2x + 1) = 847.This equation can be reduced to x = 84.Because the first ship has the least amount of people on it, we conclude x = 1.Therefore, in the first ship there are 1 person, and 2x + 1 = 2 people.The answer is 2.question: Shannon has a dishwasher that fills one-third of the dish#
