Let x be the number of pieces of pizza left uneaten.So, Bill and Dale each ate 4 x 50% = 2 pieces and Ann and Cate each ate 4 x 75% = 3 pieces.Thus, Bill and Dale ate 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of pizza and Ann and Cate ate 4 + 3 = 7 pieces of pizza.The number of pizza pieces remaining is 6 + 7 = 13.The answer is 13.question: Carlos was playing in the soccer game and his team was#

We can use the words eat = x as the unknown variable.Eat = x pizzas for Bill, Dale, and Ann.Eat = x / 2 pizzas for Bill and Dale.Ann and Cate eat x / 3 pizzas.There are 2 people who eat x / 2 pizzas, 1 person who eats x / 3 pizzas, and 3 people who do not eat pizza.Combining constants gives 4 = 4 pizzas.The whole equation is (4 + 4) / 2 + (4 + 4) / 3 = 4 pizzasThe unknown value for x is then (4 + 4) / 3The answer is 7 pizza pieces.question: Nick has 9 marbles. The sum of half#

Let x be the number of uneaten pizza pieces.Ann and Bill ate 5/4 = 2 pizza pieces.Dale and Cate ate 3/4 = 1 pizza piece.Thus, we have 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 total pizza pieces.So, we have 5x = 5 total pizza pieces.4 = x.The answer is 5.question: There are 50 men and 50#

Let A, B, C, and D be the number of pieces Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale, respectively, eat of their pizza.Since Bill and Dale ate 50% of their pizza, then the number of pieces of pizza eaten is (B + D) / 2 = 9/4 of the total pizza.In addition, Ann and Cate ate 75/100 of their pizza. So the number of pieces eaten by them is (A + C) / 2 = 5/4 of the total pizza.Therefore, the number of pizza pieces left uneaten is (B + D) / 2 + (A + C) / 2 = 7/4.Multiplying both sides by 4 gives 28 = B + D + A + C. Simplifying, this gives B + A + C + D = 28.This equation can be rewritten as A + B + C = 28.Since each number is in the equation twice, we have A + B + C = 28.This expression simplifies to C = 28 - A - B - 28.Since C is a whole number, then A + B = 28 - C = 28 - 28 = 0.Therefore, Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each ate 0 pizza pieces.The answer is 0. question.#

The pizza is divided into 4 equal pieces.So if Bill ate half of his pizza, he ate half of 4 pieces, or 2 pieces.Then Cate ate 3/4 of the pizza so she ate 3/4 of 4 pieces, or 3 pieces.Then Dale ate half of the remaining 2 pieces.So he ate 2 pieces.Then Ann ate 3/4 of the remaining 2 pieces.So she ate 2 pieces.Therefore, the answer is 4 pieces.The answer is 4.question: There are three books#

Let x be the number of pizza pieces left uneaten. Then Bill and Dale eat 2x of the pizzas. Ann and Cate eat 3x of the pizzas. Thus, 2x + 3x = 4x = 4.Then 3x = 4 - 2x so the equation becomes 3x - 2x = 2.We can then subtract 2 from both sides to give 3x - 2x = 0.Then divide both sides by 3 to get x = 2 / 3.Thus there are 4 / 3 = 2 pizza pieces left uneaten.The answer is 2 pizza pieces.question: A jar has 64 slips of paper in#

Let A, B, C, and D be the number of pieces Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale respectively ate.The sum of the pieces of pizza is 4A + 4B + 4C + 4D = 24.Because each person ate a different percentage of the total number of pieces, the pizzas have to be divided as follows: 4(A + C) = 24.Then we have (A + C)/4 = 24/4 = 6.Therefore A + C = 6.Since A, B, C, and D are integers, we must have A = C = 3.Therefore, Ann and Cate ate 3 pieces each and Bill and Dale ate 2 pieces each.The answer is 9 pieces.**Have fun!**Happy Practicing!#

Let x be the number of pieces of pizza eaten by each person.So, Bill and Dale ate x * 4 pieces.Ann and Cate ate 3x * 4 pieces.Bill and Dale and Ann and Cate ate 4 * (x + 3x) pieces.Then the equation becomes 4 * (x + 3x) = 4x + 8x.Then distribute 4x to the first term and 8x to the second term so we get 2x + 6x = 16x.Then we get 2x = 12x.To solve for x, we use 12 / 2 = 6.Therefore, each person ate 6 pizza pieces.The answer is 6.question: My shoe collection includes shoes for every season: rainy season#

Let x be the number of pizza pieces left uneaten.Each pizza is cut into 4 pieces. The number of pieces eaten are then divided by 4.So, Bill's number of pizzas eaten would be (x/4) = x/2 and Dale's number of pizzas eaten would be (x/4) = x/2.Each girl eats 75% of her pizza so Ann's and Cate's number of pizzas eaten is (3x/4) = 3x/2.So the number of pizzas eaten is x/2 + 3x/2 = 4x/2.Adding x/4 + 3x/4 gives 4x/4 = x + 3 x/4.The number of pizza pieces left uneaten is 3x/4 = x + 3 x/4.The answer is 3x/2 + 2x + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8 pieces.#

Let A be the number of pizza pieces that Ann eats. Similarly, the variables B, C, and D are defined for Bill, Cate, and Dale.Since Ann and Bill ate half of their pizza, we have (A + B) = 2 * 4.In the same way, we get (C + D) = 3 * 4.Therefore, we have the following equation.5 * A + B = 6 * 4A + 2 * B = 6A + 3 * B = 12A = 2Since Bill and Dale ate half of their pizza, we have 2 * B + D = 3 * 4.Similarly, we get 3 * C + D = 4 * 4.Let E be the number of pizza pieces left uneaten by all of them. Then E = 9 - A - B - C - D.From the previous information, we have the following equation.9 - E = A + B + C + D - A - B - C - DFrom the information, we have the following.9 - A = B + C + D - A - B - C - D.Adding A to both sides of the equation, we get 5 * A = B + C + D + A.9 - A = 4 * AA = 3A + B + C + D - A - B - C - D - 3A.Simplifying the expression, we get 6 * B + C + D = 12.Using this equation,#
