Let x equal Jesse's average over the first three days. Similarly let y equal Mia's average over the first four days. Then 30 = x + 2 * y.Solving for x reveals that x= 30/(2 * 3) = 10 and y = 30/4 = 7.Mia's average, Emily was then calculated by 7 * (3 + 1)/2 = 7.The average number of miles that they have to run from day 5 to day 7 is (10 + 7) / 2 = 13.5 miles per day.The answer is 13.5.Anytime#

Let x be the miles averaged daily by Jesse.  Their average is 2 + 3 + x on the final 3 days.Since Mia's average over the first three days is also 2 miles, we can write the above expression as 3 + 2 + xNext, add 10 miles and replace x with 3 miles for Mia to complete the final three days.Then it can be written as: 23 + 2 + 3 + 10 - 3x = 3 + 2 + 10 - 6 = 5 miles.The answer is 16 miles. The average amound they should've ran on the last three days is 16 miles.#

We have 30 (1/3) = (3)(1)(10) = 30 miles.Since each day is 1/3 mile, the average is 3.Therefore the average is 3 for 4 = 12 days.Since Jesse and Mia are already at 30, we left with 18 days.This gives 1.5 3/4 miles a day for the last three days. (1/4 + 3/4 + 1/4 = 3).The answer is 1.5 miles.question:#

let x be the average miles Jesse runs over the first three days.Then we have 3*x = 90.Distribute 1 onto 3 so we have 1* 3*x = 90.Combine like terms and the left side of the equation simplifies to 3x = 90.Put 1 onto 3x and switch both sides of the equation so that we have 3x + 1 = 90.Then put (3/2) into the equation to get 3x + (3/2)x = 30 + 60.Transfer 6 and 1 onto x to get 3/2x = 20 and form 3x = 30. Our final result is 3x = 20.Then you put 3/20 = 1.25. Therefore the average is 1.25.The answer is 1.25.question:#

2000 paragraphs. On the average was four kilometers, and that Mia was three kilometers and Jesse was 20.In Jesse’s case, the average was 5. The average of Jesse was 6.0001.In Jesse’s case, the average pace was 7. The average on the first day was 4 � 9 people.We found that the average length of Jesse was 52. Therefore, the average pace was 6.The answer is 6.question:#

Let y be the average of their average.Since Jesse ran y on Day 1, it's -2 * y on Day 2.Since Mia ran y on Day 3, it's 3 + 4 * y on Day 4.Since they ran 30 miles this week, the sum of all the miles is 30.Substituting the finishing time to Day 3 and Day 4 gives (2+4)*y=30.Splitting up the terms on the right gives 2*y+(2+3)*y = 30.Both sides are multiplied by 2 gives 4y+2*y=30.Both sides are added by 4y+2*y+4y = 30.Distributing 4 to 4y, this becomes 16y = 30-4y.Moving the constant 30-4y to the right side of the equation, this becomes 16y - 24y = 4x.Because this equation is not equal to 0, it must be equal to 1, thus y = 2.Therefore, the average of the average would be 2/4 = 1/2 for Days 5 to 7.The answer is 2/4 = 1/2 (0.5#

30(4)(234/3) = 56(132/3).The answer is 56(132/3).question:#

Let's call the amount that would have been run A.On the first three days the average that would have been run is (2/3) x30 miles = 15 miles.The following week Mia would average 3 miles per day.Therefore the amount that would have been run over the first 4 days is 4 days X 3 miles = 12 miles.Altogether the amount that would have been run with Jesses strategy is 15 + 12 = 27 miles.Thus, over the final three days the two compete would (or would have) average (.5) of their average.14) Get 25 from anywhere starting with 1, which are both odd, by addition, and subtraction only.answer: orquestion: Richard has an Easter egg hunting competition.

Let x be the average of the daily averages. x = (2/3)*30/3 + 10/4 + 3 = 5.Thus, Mia finished the race, 10+3 = 13 miles on day 4.Jesse finished the race 30/13.From day 4 on, they have to finish 4 more miles a day. They will average 8.333 miles a day on the remainder of the days. Therefore they have to run 16.66 miles in three days.The answer is 16.#

1) Jesse ran a total of 15 miles on the first 4 days.Her average is 3 miles per day.Therefore, her final average is 3 * 3 = 9 miles per day.Therefore, Jesse finished with 15/9 or 1 + ½ miles per day extra on the final 3 days.2) Mia ran a total of 15 miles on the first 4 days.Her average is 3 miles per day.So on the final 3 days, Mia has to run (3 + 15)/3 = 18/3 = 6 miles per day.Therefore, the final 3 days Mia still has to finish with 15 - 18 = -3 miles per day.So her average over the final 3 days is 3 - 3 = 0 miles per day.Therefore, the average of their averages is 9/4 = 2 + 1/2 miles per day.The answer is 2 + 1/2 miles per day.Note: All pages created#
