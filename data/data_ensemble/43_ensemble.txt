The buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake were 1.Then the number of buildings collapsed in the second earthquake were 2, since the experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one.Then, the number of buildings collapsed in the third earthquake were 4, since the number of collapsing buildings was double for each earthquake.The total number of collapsed buildings would be 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 buildings.The answer is 7.#

Each earthquake has four times the number of collapsing buildings as the previous earthquake.Let x be the number of collapsing buildings in the first earthquake, and y be the number of collapsing buildings in the second earthquake.Then 4x + 8 = 16.We then put 8 as the value of x + 2 so it becomes 4x + 8 + 2 = 16.Therefore, 4x + 2 = 16.To solve for x, we have x = 8 so there are 8 collapsing buildings in the second earthquake.Therefore, there are 8 + 4 + 4 = 16 collapsing buildings in the third earthquake.In the third earthquake, there are 16 + 2 = 18 collapsing buildings.Thus, the total number of collapsing buildings is 8 + 16 + 18 = 34 buildings.The answer is 34.answer: We have 3 containers. If we do the following:First container has 2/5,#

Let x be the number of collapsing buildings after the 1st earthquake, y be the number after the 2nd earthquake, and z be the number after the 3rd earthquake.After the first earthquake, 4 + 2 * x = 8 collapsing buildings.After the 2nd earthquake, 2 * y + 4 = 10 collapsing buildings.After the 3rd earthquake, 4 + 2 * z = 10 collapsing buildings.Let's look at the first equation, 4 + 2 * x = 8. We can make x the subject by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. 2x + 4 = 8.Distributing the 2 gives 4x + 8 = 8.Transferring 4 to the right side gives 4x + 8 = 16.Solving for x gives x = 8.The first earthquake had 8 collapsing buildings. The earthquake before the first had 2x buildings collapse. After the second earthquake, 2y + 4 = 10. We can distribute 2, giving 2x + 4 = 10. After the 3rd earthquake, 2z + 4 = 10. Distribute 2, giving 2x + 4 = 10. All in all, the first earthquake had 8 collapsing buildings, the 2nd had 10, and the 3rd had 10.So there were 8 + 10 + 10 = 28 collapsing buildings after the 3 earthquakes.The answer is 28.#

Let x be the number of buildings that collapsed from the first earthquake.There would be 2x + 4x + 8x = 15 buildings that collapsed.Putting 2, 4, and 8 in a row and multiplying by x produces 6x * 2x * 4x * 8x = 15.6x * 2x = 10x.Then we get x = 10 / 6 = 2.Therefore, the number of buildings that collapsed was 2x + 4x + 8x = 2x + 8x + 8x = 2x + 8x = 6.The answer is 6 buildings.The answer is 6.question:#

Let N represent the number of buildings that collapsed after three more earthquakes.The first earthquake collapsed 4 buildings.The second earthquake collapsed 4 x 2 = 8 buildings.The third earthquake collapsed 4 x 2 x 2 = 16 buildings.Now, there were 16 + 4 = 20 buildings collapsed after the third earthquake.Therefore, the number of buildings collapsed would be 20 x 4 = 80.The answer is 80.question: The temperature in New York last week ranged from 60 degrees Fahrenheit to 82 degrees Fahrenheit.#

There are three earthquakes. For each earthquake, there were twice the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one. So the number of buildings that collapsed at the third earthquake would be 4 * 2^2 = 16.To solve for the number of buildings that collapsed at the first earthquake, we can subtract 16 from 16 + 4 = 20. That is 16 + 4 = 20 - 16 = 4.The answer is 4.#

Let x be the number of buildings that had collapsed by the third earthquake. Then 2x + 4 + 3 = 9.Thus, the equation is 2x + 4 = 9.Then, rewrite the equation with variables only: 2x + 4 = 9.x + 2 = 5.x = 3.Therefore, there were 3 buildings that collapsed from the first earthquake.By the third earthquake, there were 2 * 3 + 4 = 10 buildings collapsed.The answer is 10.question: Jim put 37#


Let the number of buildings that collapsed after the first earthquake be x.Then for the second earthquake, the number of buildings collapsing is 2x.Also for the third earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed is 2x.By using the method of mathematical induction, we prove the general formula.We can say that after n earthquakes, there would be nx number of buildings that collapsed.We know that after three earthquakes, there would be 3 * x = 3 * x + 2 * x + x = 7 * x number of buildings that collapsed.Therefore, x = 7 / 3 = 2 * 3 / 3 = 7/3.So, there are 2 * 3 / 3 = 7/3 = 2 + 7 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 4 / 3 + 7 / 3 = 2 * 4 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 4 / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 4 / 3 + 7 / 3 = 2 * 4 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 2 + 8 / 3 = 4 / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 4 / 3 + 7 / 3 = 2 * 4 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 2 + 8 / 3 = 4 / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 4 / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 = 4 / 3 + 7 / 3 = 2 * 4 / 3 = 2 + 4 / 3 =#

Let X be the number of buildings that fell during the fourth earthquake.Then the number of buildings that collapsed during the second earthquake would be twice the number of buildings that collapsed during the first earthquake, and so would the number of buildings that collapsed during the third earthquake. Therefore, the total number of buildings that collapsed would be 4x, where x is the number of buildings that collapsed during the first earthquake.Thus the equation is 4 * X = 2x + 3x.Distribute 4 to both sides and we have 2x + 3x = 8x.Transfer 2x to the left side and we have 3x = 8x.Then add 3x to both sides to get 6x = 8x.Transfer 8x to the right side and we have 6x = 8.Divide both sides by 6 to get x = 4/3.The answer is 4.question: Jerry's has a chocolate bar with two balls#

Let x be the number of collapsing buildings.In the first earthquake, there are 4 buildings that collapse.Then the number of collapsing buildings after the second earthquake would be 2*4=8 buildings.Similarly, for the third earthquake, the number of collapsing buildings would be 4*8 = 32 buildings.Similarly, the number of collapsing buildings after the fourth earthquake would be 2*32 = 64 buildings.Adding up, we see that there are 4 + 8 + 32 + 64 = 100 buildings that collapse after four earthquakes.Therefore, the number of buildings that collapse is 100 = 4x.The answer is 100.question: The kids of 1st grade at Kellenberger school were to be taken to#
