Tim has 30 apples.
Martha has 68 apples so Harry has 68 - 30 = 38 apples.
The answer is 38.

#

Let A be the number of apples Tim has.
Then
A + 30 = Harry + 60
Combining constants, 60 = Harry + A.
Therefore Harry = 60 - A
Thus Harry has 60 - A = 40 apples.
The answer is 40.

Letesa be the number of apples that Harry has.
Combining the two facts, 30 + (1/2)*a = 68.
Applying the Law of Delimited Distributivity producción produces
"30 + [a] +[a] +[a] +[a] = 68
becomes: "a*(2n+1) = 68
Therefore, there are a apples.
The answer is a.
The question gives#

Martha has 30 more apples than Johns does.
So she has 30 + 68 = 98 apples.
Harry has half as many as Johns so Harry has 98 / 2 = 49 apples.
The answer is 49.

#

79 - 30 - 68/2 = 29
The expression simplifies to 30 - 29 = - 3.
Therefore Harry has - 3 apples.
The answer is - 3.

#

Let the number of apples that Tim has be "x".
After Harry received the half of the apples, the number of apples that Tim still has is x/2. Therefore, the number of apples that Harry has would be (x - 30).
Thus the equation is (x)/2 - 30 = 68.
After solving for x, we have x = 100 - 20 = 80.
Therefore, the number of apples Harry has is 100 - 80 = 20.
The answer is 20.

#

Since Tim has 30 less apples than Martha, he would have 30 + 60 = 90 apples.
Since Harry has half the apples of Tim, he would have 45 apples.
Martha has 30 apples less than Tim and 45 apples less than Harry so she has 30 + 90 + 45 - 45 = 178 apples.
The two numbers 180 and 178 would cancel out.
The answer is 30.


#

Let A be apples that Harry has, so Tim would have 30 - A.
Then Harry would have 30 - A -  2 * A = 4 * A.
Thus, 68 + 4 * A = 30.
Next, distribute the constant to the numerator.
68 + 4 = 4 + 12 = 16 + 4 = 20.
Thus, collect like terms.
4 * A + 20 = 30.
The solution is A * 20 = 20 * A = 100.
Therefore, 25 apples would be equal to 100 apples, so Harry would have 100 apples plus 25 apples for 250 apples total.
The answer is 25.


#

Let x be the number of apples that Harry has.
So, Tim + Harry = 30 + x = Martha.
And the answer can be substituted in 68 = 30 + x which gives 2x = 34.
The number of apples that Harry has is 2x = 34.
The equation is solved and x =#

Let A, M, and H represent the number of apples that Sarah, Martha, and Harry have, respectively.
2 * (A - M)  = 2H.
It is assumed that Sarah's apples will go first and that the expression is simplified.
multiply both sides by 2H to obtain 2 * (A - M) 2H  = A.
Solve for A to obtain A = M + H.
divide both sides by H to obtain A / H = M/ H.
The apple formula can then be applied to obtain equation H = (M / A) / (A/ H).
Every factor is multiplied by 2 and expression is simplified.
2 × M/ A = (2A/ M) = (M + H) / M.
Therefore, the expression is 2M = 2M + H.
Thus the number of apples that Martha has is 52 + H.
