Therese is 5 months older than Aivo while Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese.Therefore, Jolyn must be 2 + 5 = 7 months older than Aivo. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo but seven months younger than Jolyn.Therefore, Therese would have to be 5 - 7 = -2 months older than Leon. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo so Therese would have to be 2 + (-2) = 2 months older than Leon. Therese is answered as 2 months older than Leon.Ivanka Trump Resigned From White House Advisory Council#

Let x be the number of months. So Therese is 5 months older than Aivo so the expression is 5x. So the classmates paid out -2 where Therese and Leon pay -1.So Therese is 5*x-2, Leon is 2*x and Aivo is x.From Therese to Aivo we have x and from Therese to Leon we have another x.So from Therese to Leon we have 2x. Adding Therese we get3 * x is the same as Ther'see plus Therese plus Leon which gives us 5x+2 *x +2*x = 11x = 11+ x.So Therese's age is 2*x plus Leon's age. That is Therese's age plus Leon's age is the answer.The answer is 11+x#

Let Jolyn is y months older than Therese. Therese is y + 5 months older than Aivo. Aivo is 5 months older than Leon.So we have Therese + 5 = Aivo.Therese = Aivo - 5. Therese is y months older than Leon.So Therese = Leon - y. Combining the 3 above expressions, Therese + 5 = Leon - yTherese = Leon - y + 5.Therefore, Therese = (Leon - y)/10We have y = Therese/5 = Leon/10 - Therese/10Old answer: Let Jolyn is y months older than Therese. Therese is y + 5 months older than A#

Let x be Jolyn's difference in months from Leon.   Then Therese's difference in months from Jolyn would be x + 2,  and Therese's difference in months from Leon would be x + 5 + x = x + 7. Therefore, Therese's difference in months from Leon must be x + 6. Therese's difference in months from Aivo also must have been x + 6 since Therese has a total of x + 6 months difference with Leon and Aivo. Therese is 2 months older than Jolyn, by definition.  The equation is then  2 * (x + 6) = x.Simplifying, the equation is 3 * x = 6. Thus, the solution is x = 3. Consequently, Jolyn is 3 months older than Leon.The answer is 3.question:#

Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.  Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.This means Jolyn is essentially (2 + 5) months older than Therese.Now Jolyn is (2 + 5 ) months older than Therese, and Therese is 2 months older than Leon. Therese is (2 + 2) months older than Leon.Therefore, Therese is (2 + 5 + 2) months older than Leon.Thus the expression simplifies to (2 + 5 + 2) = 9 months.Therese is 9 months older than Leon.The answer is 9.question:#

So we can say some permutation of their birth months is: (Jolyn, Therese, Aivo, Leon) and (Jolyn, Leon, Therese, Aivo).Let X represent the months Jolyn is older, and (the length of time of one year) - X (specified length of X plus one to have a meaningful formula.)represents months Aivo is older. Therese is older by 6 months than Leon so Therese is older by 6 - X months than Leon. Therese is older by 5 months than Aivo so Aivo is older by 5 - X months than Therese.The sum of the younger months will be 2 + X - 4 = -Y2 + 2X + 1 = 0Which means X = 5 monthsSo, Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese and Therese is 5 months older than Aivo while Aivo is 2 months older than Leon. The answer is 5 months.question:#

Therese is 2 months older than Jolyn and Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. Therese = 2X.Aivo = 5(X)Then Therese + Aivo = 5(X)Comparing ages means subtracting the ages instead of adding the ages.Therese - X = 2.In addition, Leon - X = 1 monthsTherese - X + Leon - X = 1 + 1 = 2.The answer is 2.question:#

Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Therese + 5 = AivoThen Aivo - Therese = 2Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.Leon + 2 = AivoTherefore, Jolyn is 2 months older than Leon.Therefore, Jolyn is 2 months older than Leon.Therefore, the total amount of months that Therese and Leon is older than Jolyn is Therese + Leon + 2 = Jolyn.Of course, Therese and Leon are the same amount of months older than Jolyn (because Therese is two months older than Leon). If Therese + Leon is 2 months older then Therese - Leon must be 3 months younger.Therese - Leon + 2 = JolynTherese - Leon is 4 months younger.So Therese - Leon is 4 months younger than Jolyn.The number of months Leon is older than Jolyn is Leon - Therese + 2.The number of months Therese is younger than Jolyn is Ther#

Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. So Jolyn will be 7 months older than Aivo while Therese will be 3 months older than Aivo. Therese is 5 months older than Leon so Therese is 2 months older than Leon. Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese so Therese is 7 months older than Jolyn. Therese is 3 months older than Leon so Aivo is 3 months older than Leon. Therese is 2 months older than Aivo so Leon is 2 months older than Aivo.Leon is 2 months older than Biko so Leon is 7 months older than Aivo.So, Aivo is 3 months older than Leon and Therese is 2 months older than Leon. Aivo is older than Leon by 5 months.The answer is 2 + 5 = 7.question:#

Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. This means Therese was born 2 months earlier than Aivo. For example, let's say Therese was born in December and Aivo was born in November.Then Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. This means Leon was born in January and Aivo was born in December.Then Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. So it can be deduced that Helen is May born. This means Jolyn is September born(June + July + August + September).Thus, Jolyn is born in September while Leon is born in October. Therefore, Jolyn is 2 months older than Leon.The answer is 2.question:#
