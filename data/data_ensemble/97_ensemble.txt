Let Bo be the number of books that Nancy has on the top section of the book cart, and let Bb be the number of books that Nancy has on the bottom section. Therefore the total number of books is Bo + Bb. car if we are taking Bb out, how many Be was on the bottom? So then the equation would be Bo + Bb = Bb + Be Therefore we get Bb = 12, and then you just make like you did for the bottom section.The answer is 36.question:#

Let B be the number of books on the lowest level of the book cart. Since she had 4 of those books in her hand, B = 5. And of the books that did not fall out on the bottom level, she had 7 Western novels and 2 biographies. Thus we have 7 * 4 + 2 backgrounds = 23.Furthermore, since each plate had 16 fiction, 13 nonfiction and 3 poetry, the remaining books remained 17 * 16 + 13 * 12 + 3 * 10 = 139.The answer is 139.question:#

Use the notation f(x) = 12, g(x) = 8,  and h(x) = 4 to solve the problem.library = top = 12 history books + 8 romance books + 4 pocket books = 30books = bottom = 5 Western novels + 6 biographies = 11jaldi botton ition pe ke jaamna = 5 Western novels + 6 botanies = 11books left = 30 - 11 = 19books on cart = f(x) = 12, g(x) = 8, h(x) = 4 and we still need to find x.50 people take out 14 books = f(50) = 50 * (1/2 * 14)50 people take out 14 books.So we need to add 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 52, over 50, which is (52/50 = 1 + 14 = 50(14 + 14 + 14 + 30) => x = 21 rather than x = 30.The answer is21.Bottom of the cart.At this time:There are still 10 possible answers.Next part:Top#

From the top section of the cart, she shelved 6 = 6 x (12/triple of 12 books per section) = 0.5 trip of 12 books, or 5 English books.2 x [number of English books] + [number of mystery books] = [number of mystery books].5 English books - 5 mystery books equals 5 + x mystery books.The bottom of the cart. The mystery books were x = 5 x (4/triple of 4 books per section) = 0.25 trip of 4 books.8 - (0.25 x 4) mystery books = 13 mystery books.So the total number of mystery books on each trailer equals 4 x 13 + 9 + x history + 8 romance + 4 poetry = 2x mystery books which means there are 13 mystery books on the bottom section.If we add it up, it would be 13 x (1/2) mystery books on each section + x mystery books = 53 mystery books.53 books + 8 history#

12 history books, 8 romance books, 4 poetry books = 24 books at the top.We have 24 books at the top, including half mystery books so 12 mystery books.Also we have 5 Western novels and 6 biographies which comes to 11 more books.Thus, now there are total of 24 + 12 + 5 + 11 = 45 books on the cart.Two problems have been solved with Expressions. For questions raised, see Expressions.Earlier, algebraically defined expressions used words and numbers, like "a days", "50 percent", or "34 + 5*". However, strings of meaningful, general terms are also expressions, like "PI(i freaking 3) is hip" or "14pm < 70 < time2 > time2 < 25 < time1". The brackets in the last one show which of the two words, "time1" and "time2" is closer to 25 today.

Let n be the number of books on the cart.  So,  12 + 8 + 4 + (5 + 6) = 25n + x, where x represents the number of books left on the cart.The total was 12 + 8 on the top section and half of that is 12/2 + 8/2 = 39. The number of popular books on the bottom section is 4 + 5. The resulting number of books should be 25 + 39 + 8 + 5 + 6. Thus, the equation is 25 + 39 + x = 54.The left side of the equation equals LH, and the right side equal RH.Note: 3 people are naming thier grade n-percent more quickly than the last.  What was the number of books left over, x?RH: 25 + 39 = 54. (This is our 54).  LH: 25 + 12 = 37.Question: x = 37 - 12 = 25.6.The score of a Cardinal baseball player was 74 runs. The score for a runner-up still in the playoffs for the Championship is 98 runs.  What#

Let H be the number of history books and X=the number of mystery books. We also know that R = 20 books, 12 + 8 + 4 = R.Tracking the other variables shows 12 history books + 8 romance books + 4 poetry books = 24 books. Therefore, X=8 books.Subtracting the mystery books from this number gives 24 - X = 12 western books/biographies, which is equivalent to 14 minus X.This brings us to 52 - 12 - 8 = 20 equations in R.Also, H + R = 80 equations in R.Therefore, the number of history books is R - X = 20 - 14 = 6 (books).The answer is 6.question:#

Let A be the number of fiction books, B be the number of non-fiction books, and C be the number of books that Nancy shelved.Then 12 + 81 + 54 + 4 + 5 = 135.Since books must sum up to 135 we have 12 + 81 + 54 + 4 + 5 = (A + 8 + B + 6 + C) + (A + 8 + 5 + C) = A + 8 + B + 6 + C + A + 8 + 5 + C = 42 + 16 + B + 6 + C. Let K = 16 + B + 6 + C.Since 16 + B + 6 + C = (10 + 4 + K) + C.And since 10 + 4 + K = 19 + K, K = 30.  Then, 10 + 4 + 30 = B + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92.Since 10 + 4 + K = A + 8 + B + 6 + C, we have A + 8 + B + 6 + C = 92 - 30 - CGenerate the equations for the combinationsTotal books = 135All books = 45 history books - 4 romance books - 5 poetry books4 history books + 3 romance books = 10All books = 8 romance books + 6 biography books + 20 fiction books6 romance#

Allow B to equal the number of books shelved from the bottom of the cart.  Half the books that were on the bottom of the cart were mystery books, so B/2 mystery books plus 6 biographies are shelved from the bottom of the cart.  12 history books plus 8 romance books on top of the cart makes 20 books. The required number  of books on the cart is 20 + B/2 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 books when shelving starts.The answer is 26.#

Let x be the number of books on the book cart.Alternate between history and romance so that 1 x history = 4 and 1 x romance = 3.Therefore, x = 12 + 8 + 4 = • So, there were 24 books on the book cart before Nancy arrangement.
