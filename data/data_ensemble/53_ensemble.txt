Let X be the price of ice cream.X + 4X = 10X + 4X + 1X = 8So, X = $4.But X + 1X = 9So, X + 1X = 9So, X - 1X = 9 -1X = 8 -1X = 7So, X + 1X = 7 and X = $3, and$1 - 3 = -2 and X = $2Frozen yoghurt cost $1 Cartons and less ice cream is cost $3 coder would be -2.More ice cream cost more ice cream would be $2 extra.The answer is 9 ice creams and 2 frozen yoghurts.

The phrase "How much more... than..." refers to the difference in the values.Therefore, by subtracting the costs, the amount Caleb spent more on ice cream was $10-carton x 4-carton = 10carton - 4carton = 6.So, Caleb spent $10 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.The answer is 10.That concludes the most engaging and also the most diversified maths quiz that covers#

Let IceCream and FrozenYoghurt be the number of cartons of ice cream and frozen yoghurt respectively.IceCream = 10cartons andFrozenYoghurt = 4cartons.IceCream * $4 + FrozenYoghurt * $1 = (10 + 4) * $4 + 10 * $1 = 780 + 80 = $920$Thus IceCream > FrozenYoghurt. Hence, FrozenYoghurt = IceCream and the answer is 7 cartons (since each carton of frozen yoghurt costs $1).The answer#

Let ice cream costs be x and frozen yoghurt costs be y.There is an equation for ice cream costs which is 4x =$10.Frozen yoghurt costs a total of xy and ice cream spent a total of 10x. So the equation for frozen yogurts, produced from ice cream, would be 10x = y expense over x has to equal y, so y = 10x/10 = 1 x $10 = $1It will cost x to order 4 times as much as y, so 4x = 2y.Thus, x = 2y/4y = 5y/3,so x = 15y/3.Then it's easy to see from the given numbers that he payed $13 more on ice cream than on frozen yogurt.The answer is 13.question#

Let Ice Cream cost x dollars.Frozen Yoghurt cost (x/4) dollars.So Ice cream is 4x and Yoghurt is 4x/4.Since Ice Cream cost 4x dollars, x cost Ice creamOn the other hand Yoghurt cost x/4 dollars.So x/4 dollars are due to x.Keeping on doing this,x + x/4 + x/16 + x/64 + 1/64costs x + 1dollars.So the total is 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15 dollars.Multiply both sides of the equation by 15/4.Left side6.5 x = 15.25Right side6.5 x/4 = 15.2515.25 is the solution to this equation.6.5 is the only possible solution to this equation.Therefore, the solution is (15 * 4) = 60 dollars.The answer is 60.#

Let x be the number of dollars that Caleb spent on ice cream.Then, x = 10 * 4 = 40.Let y be the number of dollars that Caleb spent on frozen yoghurt.Then, y = 4 * 1 = 4.We know that x - y is the number of dollars Caleb spent on ice cream.You also know that x + y is the number of dollars Caleb spent on both ice cream and frozen yoghurt.so 10 (4 - x) - 4 (y) = 4Accordingly, we have 10-4x = 4y.Distribute 4 over to the right-hand side, so 4x = 10y.Transfer 4 to the left side, so x = 10y/4.Therefore, x = 10y / 4 = 2y or x = 20y.Therefore, x = 26 or x = 39.Therefore, x = 30.Accordingly, x = 10 = y.Therefore, Caleb spent exactly $10 more on ice cream than on frozen yoghurt.The answer is $30.question:#

Let Ice = number of cartons ice creamBuying ice creamCosts = 4 * IceFrozen yogurtCosts = 1 * IceTo find how much more was spent on ice cream than the frozen yogurt, we required Costs * Ice + Costs * Frozen yogurt = $20.4 * Ice + 1 * Frozen yogurt = $20Objective function divides 20 equally across ice cream and frozen yogurt which becomes (4 + 1) / 2 = 3.And we have 4 * Ice + 1 * Frozen yogurt = 20 so 6 * Ice = 15.Therefore Ice = 10The answer is 10.question:#

Let Ice Cream be x and Frozen Yoghurt be y.Clearly, ice cream costed 4 * x = $4x and frozen yoghurt costed 1 * y = $1:Thus, Ice Cream = 4 * x + 1 * yFrozen Yoghurt = 1 * yThen it should be clear that Ice Cream - Frozen Yoghurt + 1 = 4y + 4x - 1 = y + x - 1y + x - 1 = 4 Conversely, 4y + x = 5y + 3(x - 1) = 5y + 4x - 3 = 4.From the second step above; x - 1 = 3Thus, x = 4.Thus, Ice Cream costed 4 times as much as Frozen Yoghurt.The answer is 4 more for Ice Cream than Frozen Yoghurt.question:#

Let w be the cost of ice cream.Then the cost of frozen yoghurt would be w - 10.The equation becomes w - 10 = 5.Then distribute 1 to w ten times so that w - 10 = 5 becomes w - 10(1/10) + (1/10) = 5.Simplifying we get w - 10(1/2) = 5 which becomes 10 - 5 = 5.Thus, 10 - 5 = w = 5 each carton.Therefore, each carton of ice cream cost $5.The answer is 5.90 questions 720 pointsSPIRIT: 2020PGY#

Let x be the number of dollars that Caleb spent more on ice cream than frozen yoghurt.Thus the number of dollars that Caleb spent more on frozen yoghurt than ice cream would be 79 - x.Let y equal the number of ice cream cartons Caleb bought.The number of ice cream cartons Caleb bought would be y and the number of frozen yoghurt cartons would be 8 -y.Thus 79 - x = y + 8. - yIdentical equations produce 57 = y + 8. - yAt this point, it is reasonable to cancel y across the two equations, giving 57 = 8.The answer is 8.question:#
