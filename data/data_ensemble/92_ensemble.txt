Let S be how much money Sally has saved so far and B be how much money  Bob has saved so far.Then Sally has not yet spent (S / 4) per day and Bob has (B / 2) dollars per day.While 5 days is the number of days in a week, Sally would not be using that money in one week, so she has S / 4 in 4 weeks. Similarly Bob would not be using that money in one week, so would have B / 2 in 4 weeks.So after the first week, only half of the money should be deducted for their trip.Let S' be the new dollars Sally has in the second week, thenS' = (S / 4) - (B / 2) - 6 = 30 - 4 - 6 = 30 - 2 = 28.Bob's second week money would beB' = B - 5 x (B / 2) = B - 4 x B = B - B = 0 - 0 = 0.The answer is 28.question:#

Let x represent the total amount of money Sally and Bob have earned after a year.  x = Date1 + (1/2)Date2Where Date1 is the total money Sally earns in 1 day (in this case, 6 days), and Date2 is the total money Bob earns in 1 day (in this case, 4 days).Combine the constants to convert the equation 6 + (1/2)4 to (1/6) + (1/2)4.Divide both sides of the equation by the division of a fraction.In other words, divide both sides by 2.Then, combine like terms.8 + 16 divided by 2 gives 8 + 8 for both sides of the equation.Simplifying the both sides of the equation gives 8 = 2(x).Translating all the constant on one side results in x = 16.Therefore, the total amount earned is x = 16 days. Since there are 30 days in a month, we get to x = 480.Combining#

Let S be the amount of money that they have saved. So,   6(10) + 4(10) = 6x + 4x = 60.So, 2x = 30.With x = 15, they both have $150 saved for the trip at the end of the year.The answer is 15.question:#

Let S and B represent Sally's and Bob's savings, respectively.So, S + B would be half their total earnings.Since Sally and Bob alternate being babysitters, we sum S and B together.$S + B = ($6)(365) + ($4)(365)$Distribute 365 via linearity of addition$($6 + $4) \cdot (365)$To solve for S we need to multiple B out of the brackets$B \cdot S + $4Saving on constant $4$Only one quantity should have the same units, regardless of whether you use an equation or equate the units. So we should combine $S$ and $4$ to make a distance. Then $S$ will be in distances.$(B \cdot S + $4) \cdot (4) = $B \cdot 4Saving after $1 \cdot 365$$B \cdot 4 \cdot 365 = $$B \cdot 4,000$$10,000 minutes in one hour so $B \cdot 10,000 =#

Let x be the money Sally makes per day and y be the money Bob makes per day. So a year has 365 days and they'll have 1 day left so x= (365 * 6) / 2 = 215.  Similarly y= (365 * 4) / 2 = 180.So they can afford a total of 215 + 180 = 425.  We want to find on the one day left, how much are they going to have worked together and then divided equally. Therefore the equation is 215 + 180 = 425. (425 - x - y) / 2 + x + y = 425x + y = 145x = yThe answer is 145.question:#

Let x be the amount of money that Sally and Bob have saved.Then Sally makes (x + 0.5x) and Bob makes x.Adding they make 2.5x.Since they both saved half of the money, we have 2x.Thus their total savings is 2x + (2.5x) = 6.5x.So the equation is 6.5x = x + x that they both had saved.Which is 2x = 3.5x so there are 3.5x which in dollars, it means $3.5x = x + xTheir trip expenses are $2 so 3x = 2and so x = $1Their trip expenses are 20$.The answer is $50 question has to be subtracted"Jack and John each had 79 coins in their pockets.#

suppose that they have saved x dollars for their trip.So, they have x/2 dollars that they saved and the other half has gone to pay their babysitting fees.On a particular day, they earned 2(x) and on the next day 2(x-1) before they had to pay the fees for babysitting.The equation for their earnings is 2(2(x+1)) =4(x) and 2(2(x-1)) = 2(x-1)This means that sum equals 4(x) + 2(x-1), distributes 4(x).Simplifying the equation they have 2(2(x+1)) - 2(x-1) = 4(x)Then turns the equation into 2(x+1) - x/2= 4(x)transfer x from the right side of the equation to the left side, so they get 2(x+1) = 8 transfer x to the left side so we have x/2 + 8 = 16If 16 divide evenly into 8, giving 2, so x = 2 so they have saved 16 dollars.So they saved x = 2#

Let x be the number of days for Sally to save her money.If the number of days for Bob to save his money is 2x then the equation for Sally is 6x = 6 * x / 2.Simplifying we get 24x = 6 * x.From here, we have 6 * x = 24.Leaving the 6 aside and simplifying gives 4x = 24.Thus, the equation comes down to 4 = x + 2.Solving for x produces x = 8.Thus, Sally saves for 8 days.Then Bob will have 6 + 8 = 14 days to save his money.The answer is 14.question:#

At the very beginning, Sally and Bob each have $1.On every triplet of days they work, Sally earns $3 since her salary is $3 per triplet, while Bob earns $1 since his salary is $1 per triplet.At the end of the first triplet, Sally earns $1 so her money at the time of the next triplet is $3.Since cash is discrete, so she can not have less than $1, so the cash that Bob had at the end of the report is $2.Since Sally earned her triplet salary of $3 at the end of the first triplet, so their total savings are $1 + $3 = $4 at the end of the first triplet.At the end of the second triplet, since they earn their $1 and $3 respectively, Bob had $2, and Sally's total savings have increased by $4 to $6.Therefore, their total savings#

x is the amount Sally earns per day.Let Sally earn 3x over the year, and Bob earns 2x over the year.Job duty! There are 60 days in a year.60x - 2x = 360/300So Sally will earn 3x = 360/300.Bob will earn 2x = 240/250, so Bob earns 240/250, or 96.25.The amount Bob earns is 96.25 cents.The answer is $1,223.49.question:#
