Let x be the number of dollars Jack earns. Then x + x/2 + x/2 = 60.Multiply the 3 terms to the right by 2.2x + x + x = 60.Subtract 60 from each side.2x + x = 60 - 2x.Add the 2 terms on the right to each other to cancel the 2x and produce 4x = 60 - 2x.Divide both sides by 2 and we have 2x = 30.Subtract 2 from both sides and we have x = 28.Subtract 28 from each side to produce x = 20.Jack earned 20 dollars so Tommy earned 20 - 20 = 0 dollars.The answer is 20.question: Larry traveled into#

Let A be the amount of money that Tommy earned. Then we have the equation 60/2 = A / 2.We can factor 60 as 2 * 3 * 5, so we have the equivalent equations A = 2 and A = 3.Subtracting 3 from both sides of the first equation gives A = 2 - 3 = 1. Thus, the amount of money earned by Tommy is A = 1.Subtracting 2 from both sides of the second equation gives A = 2 - 2 = 0. So, the amount of money earned by Tommy is A = 0.Thus, the amount of money earned by Tommy was half of what Lisa earned, so A = A / 2 = 1/2.Therefore, the amount of money earned by Lisa was $2 + $0 = $2.The answer is $2.question: A bag has 13 white, 9 red, and 7 blue marbles. Write#

Let W be the amount of money Lisa earned. Let T be the amount of money Tommy earned. Let L be the amount of money Lisa earned more than Tommy.The following equation must be true: L + W = 60 + T.L + W = 60.L + W = 60 + T.L + W = 60 + W/2.L + W = 60 + W/2.Therefore, L = 60 + W/2 - W = W/2.Thus, the amount of money that Lisa earned more than Tommy is W/2.The answer is W/2.question: 6.)#

Let y be the amount of money Jack earned. Then y + y + y + y + y + x = $60.The value of x would be x + y = $60/2.So, the expression simplifies to y + x + y + x + y + y + x = $60/2.Therefore, it equals $60/2 = $30.Now, it becomes x = 30 - y and so x = 30 - 30 = 0.Now it becomes y = 30 and the answer is $30.The answer is $30.question: Sam has 20 coins. Two third#

Let x be the amount that Lisa earns and y the amount that Jack earns.So the equation is 60 = 2x + y.From the equation, 2x = 60 / 2 = 30 and y = 60 / 2 = 30.This means the number of dollars earned by Lisa and Jack was 30.The equation can be rewritten as y = 2x.Therefore, the amount that Lisa earned is 2x + y = 30 + 30 = 60.Thus the answer is x + y = 60 = 2(x + y).The answer is 2(30).The answer is 60.question#

Let x be the number of dollars earned by Tommy.Then the number of dollars earned by Lisa would be (x + 1) dollars.So, the total number of dollars they earned would be x + (x + 1) = 2x + 1.In addition, they would also earn 2x + 1 dollars.Therefore, 2x + 1 + 2x + 1 = 2x + 2x + 2x + 1 = 4x + 2.Therefore, x = 2.The answer is $2.question: How many#

Let y be the amount of money Jack earned.Let x be the amount of money that was earned by Lisa. Then 60 = x + y.By simplifying the equation, 2x = 30, we find that the amount that Jack earned is x = 20.The amount that was earned by Lisa is then x + x = 30, and therefore the difference between the two amounts is x = 30.By simplifying the equation, x + y + x = 60, we find that the amount that Tommy earned is y = 30.The answer is 30.question: Joe spends $10 every#

Let x be the number of dollars more that Lisa earned than Tommy.Lisa's earnings is 2x + 60.Tommy's earnings is 60/2.So the equation is 2x + 60/2 = 60.Divide both sides by 2 and simplify 2x = 60/2.Subtract x from both sides of the equation 2x - x = 60/2.Simplify and distribute 60/2 over 2x 2x(2x - x) = 60.Then, divide both sides by 2x 2x(1 - x) = 60/2.Expand brackets and combine like terms 1 + x = 2 - x.Therefore, x = 1 so Lisa earned 1 dollar more than Tommy.The answer is $1.question: Every#

Let L be the money earned by Lisa and let T be the money earned by Tommy. Thus, L + T + L + L = $60.Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 produces L + T = 30.Subtracting T from both sides of the equation gives L = 30 - T.Solving for L produces L = 30 - (30 - T) = 60 - TTherefore, the amount of money earned by Lisa is 60 - T = T.The answer is T.question: Jack and Lily each drank a half gallon of milk. If#

Let X be the number of dollars that Tommy earns.Lisa earned X + X + 2X = 60/2 + 60 + 120/2 = 120/2 = 60 dollars.Therefore, Tommy earns X = 60 - 60 = 0.Tommy earns no money at all. Therefore, X = 0.Lisa earned $60. The answer is 60.question: There are 5 pens#
