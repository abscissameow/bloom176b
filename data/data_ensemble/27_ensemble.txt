Let x be the number of files that were still valuable.The second round of downloading files is the same as downloading 400 files, deleting 70% of them. This is the same as deleting 70% of 400 files. Let y be the number of files deleted.This is the same as 400(1 -.7) = 240 - y.Thus, 240 - y + x = 400.After simplifying, x + (240 - y) = 400.Substituting 240 for 800 yields (y + x) = 400 - 800 = -600.Now x + (-400) = -600 which is equal to -600 - x.Subtracting the negative from both sides gives -600 + x = 0.After multiplying by -1 gives 600 + x = 0.We will solve for x with x + 0 = 0. Thus the final answer is x = -600 = - ( -800 + 400 ) = 400.Therefore, the answer is 400.question: There are#

Let x be the number of valuable files.First, in the first round he downloaded 800 files.And he deleted 70% of them.Thus, he would have 700 files remaining.Then in the second round, he downloaded 400 files and deleted 3/5 of them.Thus, the number of files deleted in the second round would be 700 - 300 / 5 = 150.So now he has x = 800 - 700 = 100 files left.The answer is 100.The answer is 100.question:#

Let X be the number of files that were left in the second round.Then, the number of files in the first round was 800 + X = X + 800.Subtracting 700 from both sides produces X + 300 = 800 - 700.Adding 800 to both sides produces 1200 = X + 300.Then, simplify the equation by distributing 300 to both sides, 1200 = 900 + 300 = 600 + 600.Finally, divide both sides by 300 to find the number of files in the second round: 1200/300 = X.To solve for X, we have 900 + 600 = X, so the number of files was 900 + 600 = X.Therefore, the number of files he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round is 900 + 600 = 1500.The answer is 1500.question: The restorers fixed an art gallery's roof by spreading#

Let A be the number of files Brennan downloads in the first round. B is the number of files he downloads in the second round.And since he deletes 3/5 of the files in the second round, x = 3/5 of the number of files he downloaded in the second round.Therefore, 80A - B = x.Letting y = 80A gives y - B = x, or 80(A + B) - (3/5B) = x.Combining constants gives 20 - B = x, or 2B = 20 - x.And since the answer must be an integer, B must be one of the following numbers: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.Let B = 17.Then we have 2A + 17 - (3/5A#

Let x be the number of files that he was left with.Then there were 800 files to begin with. But he deleted 70% of them, so the files left after deletion was x = 800*70% = 560 files.Then in the second round he deleted 3/5 of them so the files left in the second round was x = 560 * 3/5 = 266 files.So he was left with x = 266 + 400 = 676 files.The answer is 676.question: A shopkeeper was#

There were 800 files downloaded. 70/100 = 700 out of 800 were worthless.After the second round, 4/5 = 400 files were irrelevant. 400 + 3/5 = 480 files were not valuable.400 out of 800 files were not relevant to the project. Therefore, 400/700 = 600/700 files out of 800 were valuable.The answer is 600/700 = 900/500 files.There were 900 files downloaded in total. The number of files relevant to the project was 900/#

Let x be the number of files that Brennan had left after deleting the irrelevant files.So, in the first round, he had 800 - 700 = 100 files to download. And in the second round he had 100 - 3/5 = 87 files to download.So there are 87 files that he had downloaded before deleting them.Therefore, there are 87 - 400 = 87 - (400 / 5) = 87 - 200 = 67 files remaining in the second round.So the number of files left is 67 + 87 = 155.The answer is 155.We hope that you liked these problems and that#

Let V be the number of valuable files that Brennan has remaining. So there are 400 - V - 3/5(400 - V) = 200.Distribute V to the parentheses to give (3/5)(400 - V) + V = 200.Simplify to get 4/5V + 200 = 200 and rearrange to get V = 50.Hence, after the second round, the number of valuable files he had remaining was 50.The answer is 50.question: Nick used 9 cents#

In the first round, he downloaded 800 files that had 2/5 (400 files) relevant files.So after deleting the files, he is left with 2/5 = 400 relevant files.In the second round, he downloaded 400 files and deleted 70% = 210 irrelevant files.So the number of relevant files remaining after deleting irrelevant files is 210*400/3 = 840/3 = 266 files.The answer is 266.question: Shane had an IQ of 145, the highest in his class.

Let x be the number of valuable files.The number of irrelevant files deleted in the first round is 0.7 * 800 = 560 irrelevant files in the first round.That is 800 - 560 = 240 files remaining after the first round.If 3/5 * 400 = 180 irrelevant files were downloaded in the second round, then the number of files remaining is 240 - 180 = 60 files.Therefore, x = 60 files.The answer is 60.question: Alice got two lollipops and#
