Let x be the number of green hats removed by John.Then 2x = 6.That is, twice as many green hats were taken away as pink hats.Adding the number of hats removed by Carl and John to the remaining hats gives 2x + 4 + x + 26 = 65.The answer is 65.#

Let X be the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck.Pink hard hats removed by Carl = 4Pink hard hats removed by John = 6Green hard hats removed by John = 2*6Total number of hard hats removed = 4 + 6 + 2*6 = 20This leaves X = 26 + 15 + 20 - 20 = 4The answer is 4.question#

Let x be the number of hard hats that Carl takes. y be the number of hard hats that John takes. z be the number of pink hard hats taken by Carl. w be the number of green hard hats taken by John.Thus, 4 + 6 + 2*z = x.Then the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is y + z - x = 26 - x.Combining constants gives 7 + z = 26 - x.Adding x to both sides gives 7 + z = 26.Then 4 + 6 = 10 so z = 2.Substitute x = 6 and z = 2. Thus, y = 5 and the number of hard hats that remained in the truck is (y + z - x) = (5 + 2 - 6) = 15.The answer is 15.question: Of the first 50 students that#

Let G be the number of green hard hats.Then, the pink hard hats subtracted by Carl would be 4 so the green hard hats subtracted by John would be 6 + 2(G) = 2G + 6.Also, 2(G) + 6 = 2(G + 4) = 2G + 6.Subtract G from both sides, so 2(G - 1) = 2G + 6 - G = 2G - 4.Then divide both sides by 2 to get G + 4 = 2G - 4/2.And G + 1 = 2G - 4.Solving for G, G = (2 - 1)/2 = 0.75.The total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is 2(0.75) + 1 = 15.75.The answer is 15.75.question: Denise spent a#

Let x be the total number of remaining hard hats.Since Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, x = 26 + 15 + 24 - 4 = 51 + 16 = 67.To solve for x, we have 67 = 4x.Combining constants to solve for x gives 4 = 67 / 4 = 17.The total number of hard hats that remained in the truck was 67 - 4 = 63.The answer is 63.question: If Carole bought three times as many pens#

There are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. So the total number of hard hats in the truck is 26 + 15 + 24 = 63 hard hats.Carl took away 4 pink hard hats and John took away 6 pink hard hats and 2x green hard hats.So Carl removed 4 + (2x) = 6 pink hard hats and John removed 6 green hard hats.The total number of removed hard hats = 6 + 6 = 12 hard hats.The total number of hard hats in the truck is 63 - 12 = 51 hard hats.The answer is 51.#

Let n be the total number of hard hats.Then 26 - 4 = 22 = 22 + n - 6The equation becomes 22 + n = 26 - 6To solve for n, substitute x = n + 22 into the equation so it becomes 26 - 6 = 22 + x.Adding 22 to both sides of the equation gives 30 = 22 + x.By subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get 22 = 12 - x.To solve for x, we have 12 - x = 22 which is 2x = 12.Then the value of x is 6.Therefore, there are 22 + 6 = 28 hard hats left.The answer is 28.question: There#


There are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats in the truck. Since Carl removed 4 pink hard hats, the total number of hard hats is x - 4 pink hard hats - 6 green hard hats = x - 8 pink hard hats - 6 green hard hats.Simplifying the expression and rewriting it gives 24 - (x - 4 - 6) = x - 24 - 12.Combining the constants on the right side gives x = 24 - 12.The total number of hard hats is 24 - 12 = 12 pink hard hats and 12 green hard hats.The answer is 12.question:#

 Let x be the total number of hard hats that remained.The total number of pink hard hats is 2x, the number of green hard hats is x, and the number of yellow hard hats is 26 - (2x + x) = 24 - 2x = 22 - x.So the number of green hard hats is the same as the number of yellow hard hats, and we know that John took twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he took away. If c is the number of green hard hats that John took, then the number of yellow hard hats that he took is c + 2c = 26 - (2x + c) = 26 - x - 2c.Then we have 24 - x - 2c = 22 - x.To solve for c, we have 24 - x = 22 - x - 2(24 - x) = 22 - 2x.So, the equation simplifies to 22 - 2x = 22 - 2x - 2x = 0.And 22 - 2x is also equal to 22 - 22 - x.So, 22 - 2x is equal to x.If we solve the equation we get x = 22.Therefore, the number of green hard hats is 22.The number of yellow hard hats is 22 - 2x = x.Therefore, the number of yellow hard hats is#

Let x be the number of green hard hats that John takes away.Then there would be 26 + 15 + 24 - 6 - 4 = 52 hard hats remaining.Combining like terms in the 52 leaves 26 + x + 24 = 52.Adding x + 24 to both sides of the equation, we get 26 + 2x = 52.Dividing both sides by 2 gives 13 + x = 26.Simplifying the equation, it becomes 6 + x = 12.Since the value of x must be a positive integer, the value of x = 6.Therefore, there are 52 - 4 - 6 = 32 remaining.The answer is 32.question: A truck is carrying wood#
