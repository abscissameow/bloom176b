How many digits did Carlos memorize?Carlos memorized 10 digits.Sam memorized 8 digits,Carlos memorized  fewer digits than Sam. (8 - 10) digits.Each digit has 9 other digits.9(8 - 10) = 90 (digits).Mina memorized 3 times as many digits. (90 / 3) digits.24 digits + 90 / 3 = 24 + 9 = 33 digits.Therefore, Sam memorized 33 - 8 = 25 digits.The answer is 25.question:#

If Sam knew 6 digits, and Mina memorized 6 times that, then Mina knew 6*6 = 36 digits. If Mina knew 36 digits, and Carlos knew six times as many, then Carlos knew 36*6 = 216 which is also 6 digitsThe answer is 6 digits.And that was#
