H = 60 mango trees.F = 5 coconut trees.The number of all trees  is H + F = 60 mango trees + 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees = 60 mango trees + (60 x (1/2) = (60 x (1/2) = (60 x (1/2) = 30 coconut trees.Therefore, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is: H + (F + (H x (1/2) trees in all.The answer is 120 trees.The problem asks how many trees Randy has in all - not how many coconut#

First, convert the half to decimals. The ones place changes from 1 to 5 and the thousands place changes from 6 to 3.Do a multiplication of 3 x 2 = 6.2Adding 6 to the 60 mango trees leaves us with 66 trees.Dividing by 2 gets us 33 coconut trees.66 mango trees + 33 coconut trees = 99 trees.The answer is 99.#

Randy has 60 mango treesSo he has 5/4 of coconut treesWhich means he has 15/4 = 11 coconut treesThen he has a total of 60 + 11 = 71 treesThe answer is 71.question:#

On Saturday, he picked 75 kg of mangoes and 57 kg of coconuts. He ate mangoes all day Sunday and half coconuts all day Sunday.On Monday, he ate mangoes for 8 hours and coconuts for 9 hours.And so on.Everyday, he ate mangoes for n hours and coconuts for m hours.Let's substitute n and m, so we have 75n = 8/1n + 57m = 9/1m. Solve these two equations.So we get 75n = 8n + 57m = 9m. Here n = 9 and m = 5, given in question.In the total number of trees he has 75000m + 50000n = 150 000. 
And n+m = 115 because every day he picks 75 kg mangoes so thus we get m = 75000 and n = 50000.And so the number of trees is 150 000.The answer is 150 000.
The answer is 110.question:#
