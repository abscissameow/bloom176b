The first 60 megabytes takes 60 seconds.The next 40 megabytes takes 40*10/5 = 80 seconds.The remaining 10 megabytes takes 10 seconds.The total amount of time is 80+60+10 = 210 secondsThe answer is 210.20 Categorieshere there be Math#

For the first 60 megabytes of the file, it downloads at a rate of 5*60 megabytes = 300 megabytes downloads.For the second 60 megabites of the file, it downloads at a rate of about 10 megabytes*60 megabytes = 600 megabytes downloads.The next 120 megabytes downloads at the slower rate of 10 megabytes per second for the remaining 320 megabytes over the duration  Xception is a registered trademark of the National Center for Competitive Examinations (NCFE).

At the ratio of its first 60 megabytes to its last 10 megabytes, its download time (in seconds) is 60 : 10 = 6 : 1 which is 6 : 1 = 6 5 : 1 = 6 × 5 = 30 seconds.The download time is equivalent to 30 seconds in a minute.The answer is 30 seconds.view more#

The file takes 60 seconds to download at a rate of 5 megabytes per second.  So it’s 60 megabytes / 5 megabytes per second = 12 secondsThe file will then take:  60 megabytes / 10 megabytes per second = 6 secondsBy combining 60 - 12 and 6 we get finally a number of 48 seconds.The answer is 48 seconds.#

x = 60  y = 60  60 / x + 60 / y x + y = 90  x = 30  y = 60  x + y = 90  60 / x = 15 seconds  60 / y = 12 seconds 60*(15) + 60*(12) = 90*60 = 5400 seconds 40 minutes.The answer is 40 minutes.question:#

Shorter rates apply for first 60 MB  rating  : { 5 Megabytes per second for the first 60 MB - 6 seconds60 * 6 = 360 secondsPer 10 Megabytes per second = (60 MB -> 360 seconds) + (10 MB -> 360 seconds) -> 510 seconds510 / (60 - 1) = | -> 1.67  megabyte producing 1.67 seconds additional. final result will be 6 + 1.67 = 7.67  secondsthe floor uses to give 7 seconds.The answer is 7 seconds.question:#

Let f(x) be the download speed for the first 60 megabytes.f(x) = 5*60 (megabytes) After 60 megabytes, the download speed doubles. To find f(x) for the second half of the file, x must be doubled, 1 minute of downloading with 60MB download speed is the same as 1.5 minutes of downloading with 120 MB(megbytes) download speed.From 60 megabytes, the download speed will be 120 MB(megabytes) for x seconds.To convert the hour unit to the second unit, multiply 2.5 (one hour is 2.5 hours) x 60 (minutes) so that it becomes 2.5x60 = 120 minutes.File size in seconds : f(x) = 120 MB(megabytes) for x hours/minutes. So 1 MB = 60x seconds.So, 90 megabytes = 3600 seconds : 1200 megabytesFor the second half of the file, ft(x) = 3600/2020 seconds = 1.75x seconds#

Time is t = 1500 + 600 * 9 = 5400 secondsThe answer is 5400 seconds.#

$\frac{1}{5}$ of the first 60 megabytes, or 30 megabytes, is downloaded each second. So 60 / 30 = 2 seconds, which means the entire download takes  $\frac{1}{5}$ of 60 + 60 / 2 = 100 seconds.The answer is 100 seconds.question:#

The file is 90 MB with 60 MB downloaded at 5 MB per second and the rest of 90 MB downloaded at 10 MB per second, the total MB downloaded is 90 + 60 + 30 = 150 MBThe time in seconds is 150 Mb/(10 * 8) = 150 / (10*1000) = 20.25 secondsThe answer is 20.25.question:#
