The first value must be 1/5 of the unknown weight it needed to gain.Next, 1/5 of the bear’s weight = 1000 pounds / 5 = 200 pounds.The second value must be half of the remainder.So 200 + 200/2 = 400 pounds.The final valuenow equals 200 pounds + 400 pounds = 600 pounds.The answer is 600 pounds.#

5/20 = 25 percent of 1000 pounds goes to summer berries5/10 = 50 percent goes to autumn acorns4/10 = 40 percent goes to summer berries2/10 = 20 percent goes to small animalsDuring summer, bear has gained 25 percent by feasting on berries.During autumn, bear has gained 50 percent by feasting on acorns.During summer, bear has gained the remaining 20 percent by feasting on small animals.Therefore, the number is: 25 + 50 + 20 = 95%The answer is 95 pounds.  ****Thanks to Contribute 4 Nepal for utmost ur efforts for putting#

The total pounds gained from the berries were 0.2*5 = 1 poundDuring autumn, the bear needed the same amount of pounds from acorns it gained from berries. The weight from acorns were 1 pound, so acorns weight is 1+0 = 1 pound total.Since acorns make up.5*.5 =.25 of the remaining pounds, then there are (1000-1000), 0.25 = 250 pounds for the small animals.Hence, the pounds gained from small animals is 250.The answer is 250.In this exciting word for word word game, each player is#

It gained half by eating woodland animals. So it's 1000 / 2 for the woodland animalsIt gained 100 pounds eating small animals for it's win weightIt gained the other 200 from the salmonIt gained all 2000 from salmon and woodland animals so 1000 + 200*2 + 200 = 2000So the answer is 2000.question:#

A fifth of 1000 pounds is 166.67 poundsFrom the summer berries = 166.67 poundsFrom autumn acorns = 333.33 poundsThe rest of the 1000 pounds are split 50/50 = 476.67 poundsThe total the bear gained from small woodland animals was 166.67+332.67+476.67 round to the nearest whole pound for a total of 1000 poundsThe +/- pounds gained from small woodland animals can't be +/-266.67--> small animals = 268.67 poundsThe answer is 268.67 pounds.Hopefully you'll find something fun in there,#

Berries- summerWeight to gain = 1000 pounds.Fraction of weight gained = 1/5 of 1000 = 100Weight gained from berries = 100 pounds.Small animals- autumnWeight to gain = 1000 pounds.Fraction of weight gained from animals = 2/5 of 1000 = 200Weight gained from small animals = 200 pounds.Acorns-autumnWeight to gain = 1000 pounds.Fraction of weight gained = 2/5 of 1000 = 200Weight gained from acorns = 200 pounds.Safu meaning half weight = 200 poundsSo total weight gained from all foods is 100 pounds + 200 pounds + 200 pounds = 500 poundsTherefore the answer is 500 - (100+200) = 300 pounds.question:#

The question says that the bear needed to gain 1000 pounds. Its increased weight comes from eating berries in summer (5 pounds), and acorns in autumn (5 pounds).The bear ate 500 pounds of berries in summer and 1000 pounds of acorns in autumn.Since the weight from berries in summer is 5 pounds and the weight from acorns in autumn is 5 pounds, the weight from salmon in spring is 1000-5-5 = 500 pounds. The remaining 500 pounds can be found from 500/2 = 250 pounds.The answer is 500.#

The bear is nearing the end of the summer and has eaten 1000 pounds of food. 1/5 of the 1000 pounds came from summer.  The number that the summer portion represents is 1000/5 = 200 pounds of food the bear ate from berries over summer. The remaining 800 pounds (obtained by subtracting 200 from 1000) came from autumn, acorns, and the remaining 800/4 = 200 pounds of food the bear ate from acorns. Salmon accounted for eating 200 pounds of food. During autumn, it acquires 100 pounds of food by feeding on small animals. Salmon made up 50% of the remaining weight to be gained. Is this true?answer: Yes, it is true.The#

Weight Gained = 1000 x 5 / (5 + 4 + 2)= 250 The bear ate berries in summer.Weight Gained = 1000 x 2 / (5 + 4 + 2)= 500 Salmon accounted for half a totalBerry weight accounted for ¼ of the remaining weightAcorns accounted for ¼ The answer is 250.question:#

Berries –_______________________ Acorns –______________________ Salmon –_________________ ___grams{We know that the bear gained 500 grams from berries, it gained 1100 from acorns. The other 500 grams it gained from eating small woodland animals.Therefore the bear gained 500 + 1100 + 500 = 2000}Thus, for every 1000 pounds to be gained, only 200 pounds were to be gained from small woodland animals. The answer is 500 pounds.The given information of the question gave the bear#
