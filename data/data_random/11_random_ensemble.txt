he has $15 each month, so $3 a month for 3 months.The $15 is a total of $4.50. The shoes cost $95.Much of the $4.50 went to his savings. Tobias earns $15 each month or $30 each month if we count the mowing and shoveling.  He only has $95 so he only paid $95-$4.50=$90.90 trees were cut to make the $15 change. 90*4=360 treesTo mow every house lawn, 360 trees long drives were cleared. Clearing the long drives left 7 driveways there to clean.So with 3 months of mowing cleanings Tobias found $7.20 left over.7*4=28.2No plants had been cut and all had been spent on cleanup.So he had $6 left.$16.2If he do any more mowing he won't make enough at other things to earn the change.His final number is $6 left to buy the shoes$16.#

He has $15 saved which he gets from his parentsOne lawn costs $15 and he mows 4 lawns4 * 15 = $60Canceled the mow way $15He has 60 - 15 = $45 dollars to pay for shoveling$7 * 3 = $21foot ways canceled = $14$24 - $14 = $10 dollarsOne shoes cost $95. If 10 dollars were spent for shoveling, how many was for buying the shoes? The answer is 10.question:#

Tobias gets a gift of $5 every month.So, in total he gets 12 months $5 = $5x11Suppose it takes 8 months for Tobias to save up $95 as he spent part of his money on shoes.In 8 months, he gets=$5x8 =$40 divided by 4 lawnsmowing a lawn is the same as saving $10$40/4 = $10dividing by $7shoveling a driveway is the same as spending $12$40/7 = $12This means that he spends $12 to mow a lawn and saves $10 the same monthHe will be left with $10-12 = -2 to mow a lawn and + 2 dollars to shake a driveway etc.So, he will mow 2 lawns and shake 2 driveways and leave the change of $+2-3 = +1The answer is 15.question:#

Loosely translated, he has $20 left over. But: 95 + $15 + $15 = $140The price of the shoes is $95 + $15 = $120.So: $20 - $120 = $20His $20 includes his $15 + $7 = $22He spent $15 to mow a lawn, so he got 4 lawns for $5Driveways cost $7 each and he spent $20 on the shoes, so he shovelled 20 driveways, ignoring the fact that he was charging more than he had and had garage sale prices, the simplest way to do this is to say - $2 dollars for each mowing and $7 dollars for the shoes  so  $20 divided by $7 = 3 The answer is 3.#

15% of 95 $=$155% of 8 $=$85The change he gets after buying the shoes is $95-15= $80For him to save money he must earn more than $15 every month.For him to earn this $15 each month, he needs to mow a lawn that costs $15+ $7 (he gets $7 more for the shoveling) = $22The answer is 5.question:#

The shoe cost $95 so he needs 95*5=495 dollars for them. If he gets a 5 dollar allowance each month (15 dollars every three months), He has 60 dollars left and he can mow 4 lawns.The charge for mowing a lawn is 15 dollars and for shoveling a driveway is 7 dollars.If a lawn is mowed 4 times and shoveled twice it is charged with 4*7 + 2*15 = 67 dollars.Let the charges of mowing and shoveling be a, b respectively.If there are 4 lawns mowed, it means 1* 4 = 4 lawns mowed.Let the 4 lawns be x.Then 4*74 of x and 4 lawns is 2*67 of x.If the loys of lawns mowed is 4, let x be 4.Now x is 4.Thus 4x + y = 67 where y=2x. 4 implies x = 4. 4x = 2 x 2*4 x = 8.Hence 4 lawns and 4 lawns 4 piles 9 shovels. The 4 lawn#

He gets $7 to shovel a driveway, 4*7 = 28We know he mows 4 lawns and he gets $7 to shovel a driveway. 4*7 = 28The $4 of the shoes, the $15 mowing money, and then the 28 in change leaves us with $17.20.So we must have shoveled 17/20 x 6 = 23 driveways.The answer is 23.

Tobias was saving his money for the past three months.He saved $48 right away, then $15 each month for the next three months, for a total of $105.So he has $48 + $105 = $153 in today's money.Tobias has started using some of his money. Since he has 15 change, he did not buy the shoes with all the money he has earned so far. If he mows 4 lawns, it means he has $15 + $48 + $105 - 4 x $7 = $131 left. That is $15 more than his money so far.If he mows more than 4 lawns, Tobias was not able to buy the shoes with his money so far.If Tobias mows 7 lawns, for example, he needed to mow seven lawns and shovel seven driveways. Since he charged $7 for every lawn he mows and $7 for every driveway he shovels, he made $63 by doing both,#

We know that Tobias bought the shoes so has $95$ in change. He also mows 4 lawns in one week, so he will clear $120$ in one week. We know that he also shovels 7 driveways.This means he will travel $120 - 7x200 = 30$ in one week.For the 3 months he has spent saving for the shoes, he mows $120x3 = 360$ lawns.Therefore, he shovels $$ 360 - 30 / 34 = 70$$ out of the 8 driveways.In total, he shovels $70 / 8 = 9$ driveways.The answer is 9.question:#
