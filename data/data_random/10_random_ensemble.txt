Since each ship has twice as many people as the last ship: first 4 ships have 2*4 = 8 people, first 8 ships have 8*2 = 16 people, first 16 ships have 16*2 = 32 people, first 32 ships have 32*2 = 64 people, ……first 847 ships have 847*2 = 1716 people.The monster ate the ship that had 847*32 = 26524 people.The answer is 26524.question:#

In the first 100 years, the monster ate 847 people. The last ship, built every 100 years, is therefore the 847nd largest ship.  The last ship contains 848 people.Each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.Therefore, the first ship had 2 x 848 = 1764 people.Since the first ship has twice as many people as the last ship, from the 847 people The monster ate, we need to subtract the 848 people who were on the first ship.  847 - 848 = - 1Since it is negative, we actually subtract this negative from 847 to find the 847 people the monster ate in the first 100 years.The answer is 847.question:#

Each new ship has twice as many people, so over time that means that for each ship lost, we lose the same amount of passengers.This equation applies to the first ship lost:200 + 800 * 0.5 = 200Looking for the total people lost: 200 + 800* 0.5* 0.5 + 800* 0.5* 0.25 +.... = 200 + 400* 0.5 + 400* 0.25 +... = 200 + 400 +... = 200 + 400^n = 847^n = 847 questions have been discussed below, 819, relating to Coding Cyberpunk News Considering how eagerly awaiting the next season of Stranger things will be, and how much of its second season has already illuminated, the Netflix and State of art platform throws out some spoilers today, about the Seasons of 5 that Stranger business 3 brings to Happy to including the number and order of the sections.

He ate 28 people so that 400 + 28 = 848 peopleOver the hundred years, he ate 28 + 643 = 847 peopleHis eating grows exponentially so it will eat m+847 where m = number of people on the first ship.His diet grows over time. The next day, he "eats" 27 people since there are more people.His diet grows over time. So to calculate the number of people he eats in the first year, we have  is the number of people he eats each day.his growth is exponentialEinstein's calculation is at a "growth" rate of approximately one person per yearThat means a yearLaterShipA ship inFirst yearM28peopleShip inSecond yearM42peopleShip inThird yearM84peopleShip inFourth yearM168peopleThe growth is approximately 42 people from one ship to the nextThe enough information, it can say#

It ate 847 people in three centuriesThat means it ate 847 / 100 years = 84.7 people/centuryOver the course of the first hundred years before ships got bigger, it ate 84.7 * 100 = 847 people. Ships were getting bigger, so those were 433 new people = 847 + 433 = 1,098 people eaten.  The monster ate 1,098 people in total.The answer is 1,098.question:#

The monster ate 847 people over the 300 years. The ship the monster consumed the first time could only hold 847/300 = 25 people.It ate the people and then destroyed the ship. When the creature comes back, it will want to eat the same number of people, only now the ships can hold twice as many people. Thus, the ship will transport half the people that ship can hold, so it would contain Depending on the answer, they might tell you that the first ship held 25 x 2 = 50 people, and that people were farmed in a completely uneven distribution. So the#

Using math we know 1000 = 100 *10So 847 people in 300 years is 8.47 per yearHow many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first 100 years?847/300=1.9x1000=1900It's clear to say there were 1900 people on the ship.So the answer is 1.9x1000=1900.question:#

Not possible to calculate as there is no proposed number of people in the mentioned scenario. The question is unclear and doesn't provide enough basic information for a completed calculation to be possible. The question should either be quantified or made clear whether or not the deer will eat both crabs and fish.question: Carol, Rima, and Loretta play chess. Each of them is a different strength. Carol can win 4% of the time that Rima gets to play, while Rima can win 6% of the time that Loretta gets to play. During a particular game, they each have a 50% chance of winning (this goes for some simpler equation, such as rounded-down to the nearest integer or summing the two positive operators, we find that 50 - (-4 - 6) = 10, so#

It ate 8.7 people per year if we multiply times 100. 8.7 / 1 year 100 years = 847 peopleThe answer is 847.question:#

First, we find how many years are in the first hundred years : 100 = 72 years (firsthole bearing 72 and 3001st hole bearing 100)What we must do now is make it into an equation, but this time we will express the second term in terms of the first. This is something that we already know how to do, and multiplying 848 x 72 x 1/847 is a good way to go. First, we place the 3001st hole bearing of 1/847, at the start of our 482nd hole, which is known as the 72nd hole, meaning 72 times 1/847. Then, we reposition the reset at 100% lane division, and use the third hole to measure from for 72 times 1/847, meaning 1/847 represents 2 inches.1 x 1/847, meaning 1/847 represents 1 inch.Finally, 72 x 1/847, meaning 1/847 represents 1/2 inch#
