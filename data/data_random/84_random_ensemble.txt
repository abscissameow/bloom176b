There are 10 floors with 10 rooms each, for a total of 100 bedrooms.Since the hotel has 105 rooms, Hans can stay in 1/10 = 10 of them.Since the 10th floor is already occupied, he cannot choose the room on that floor.The remaining 9 rooms can be in any of the 9*9 = 81 rooms.The total = 10 + 81 = 91The answer is 91/100question: Jonah was fat last year. For the holidays he's decided to eat only fish and to exercise more#

Easy.Think about the rooms you could place him in.He can't be placed on the last floor. 10 divided by 9 gives 1 room.10 divided by 8 gives 2 rooms. 10 divided by 7 gives 3 rooms.10 divided by 6 gives 4 rooms. 10 divided by 5 gives 5 rooms.10 divided by 4 gives 6 rooms. 10 divided by 3 gives 7 rooms.10 divided by 2 gives 8 rooms. 10 divided by 1 gives 9 rooms.The answers are 9, 10, and 10.10. Make an addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problem, then do#

The ten rooms on the same floor have the same number. So there are only 10 numbers to choose from.Therefore, the number of different rooms he can check inn is 10.The answer is 10.question:#

The last floor has 10 x 9  rooms therefore Hans could ask for the last floor and you can find number of ways: 10 choose 9or 10! / 9! × 1The answer is 10 choose 9.question:#

The last floor is unavailable for the guests, so H has to be checked into one of the 9 * 8 = 72 total roomsIf there are 72 available rooms and the highest floor is 10, they would take all 72 room numbers but skip (talk about and ignore) digits numbered 11 to 99So he can be checked into any room number from 11 - 99 but lets say he goes for 201 charity or 204 lol-all-lots (home of lot).His room number is 201 which means the number to the left of a dot (.) is 1, and 100 is one digits left of the next dot.(The one left of a dot is 1 from the 317 room number + the 200 room number = 201Anyway, Thomas would be chilling with his hair to the left of 1 which is 201 and he would be chilling with (200) rooms left of the dot. (not including the room#

The maximum amount of rooms he can be checked in is 10 * 10 = 100.The minimum amount of rooms he can be checked in is 9 * 9 = 81.The first floor of the building has 10 rooms, the next floor has 10 rooms, etc. until the 10th floor has 10 rooms.Since there is no 11th floor, Hans can only be checked in the rooms up to and including the 10th floor.This means he can be checked in 9x10 = 90.If we subtract the empty rooms there are 90-90 = 0.Because there is a floor that doesn't have guests, the answer is 0.Choose any topic from the topics listed below to start.There are problems listed#

each floor represents a room in the hotel, we can represent each floor with a number from 1 to 10.  The numbers of floors can be represented as:floor number1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 possible rooms10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 10 question asks for how many different roomsn(The number of floors) =  total number of rooms = 10 n = 10*10 = 100A parenthesis will represent a room in the hotel, so lace ( represents one room, and )( represents a second room.
