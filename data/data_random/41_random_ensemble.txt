Sara spent $50 on shoes and $200 on dress.Rachel spends (50*2 + 200) = $400Therefore Rachel spends $400 + 200 = $600.The answer is 600.#

Sum of Sara's expenses = $200 + $50 = $250 Since Rachel wants to spend twice what Sara spent on shoe and dress, let x + y = $250$$x + y = $250\quad\\2x + y = 250\quad\\2x + 250 = 250\\100x + 250 = 250\quad\\100x = 250 - 25x\quad\\\left\{x = \frac{1}{5}\left(\frac{250}{100}\right)\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,y = \frac{1}{25}\left(\frac{250}{100}\right)\text{.}\right.$$Since x represents the money they spent on shoe, take 50 = 50/100*5 = $50 and then take 2 * 50 = 100 = 100/100*5 = $200, since x represents the money they spent on shoes and y represents the money they spent on dress.Thus, Rshee spents $50 on shoes and $200 on dress.The answer is $50+$200=$250$The answer is $200$.#

hey both bought a pair of shoes $$$50$$ and a dresses **$200$$.$$$(2*50)*2+200=$$$(100*4)+(______)$$$$$300+2*200*2=$$$600$$ the equation of the line is $Ax + By = C$. You can work out line equation using this. From this we can work backwards.We know that $50 * 2 = $100 so now we can fill in the missing number: 200A = B = C = 50From there we can work backwards.If we want to find the slope we can divide anota: $slope = \frac {${amount car left}$}{${hours}};$$sum = 2;$$ categories times sum = 62;$$categories = 2$$slope: ($400$)/($6$)=2/4 = $5/10,$$So I get 0 on all rubrics. Should I try again?question: __________ consulting put out a notice that they are offering a once in a lifetime opportunity in account#

she needs an amount that is twice as much as what sara spent.Note that sara and rachel did not switch their shoes and dresses. Therefore sara buys a: $50 shoes and a $200 dressSo sara spends: $50 + $200 = $250So rachel needs: 2 * $250= $500So rachel spends: $500 + $50 + $200 = $550So rachel spent is too $550 + $50 = $600The answer is 600.#

Using $50 for the pair of shoes and $10 for the dress, Rachel spends $50+$10+200= $310.If she had spent anything less than that, she would not have spent twice as much as Sara.The answer is $310.question:#
