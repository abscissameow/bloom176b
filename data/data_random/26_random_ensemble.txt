20% of 2 liters = 0.4 liters Jack collects 7 liters of salt when all the water evaporatesN.B: One liter is equal to 1000 ml.The answer is 7 * 1000 / 1000 * 0.4 = 2880ml. The answer is 2880 millilit#

The total volume of the bucket is 2* 1000 = 2000cubic mlThe total salinity is 2000 x 20% = 400cubic mlThe salinity per ml is 20mlSo, 2000 ml divided by 20 and then divided by 1000ml = 80 ml of saltThe answer is 80 mlquestion: Danni is a really good golfer.

If water is 20% salt, it means the percentage by which the salt is present is 20% of the total.If the salt is 20% of total water, it means salt is 4/2 litersThe volume of salt will be 2 l*4/2 liters=1.2 lSalt has a volume of 1.2 l*1000mL/1000=460mlSalt has a total volume of 460 ml+2000 ml=2 460mLTotal volume of salt is 2 460 mlThe answer is total volume of salt: 2 460 ml.Manchester teachers are very well qualified to prepare students to enter top#

20% salt means 100% water has 20% salt.Let's assume C is the number of milliliters of salt. 2 liters of seawater is 2000 ml or 2000/2000 or 1 liter of 100% waterAfter he collected all the water in his bucket which was 2 liters, he placed the 2000 ml of absolute water in a bigger empty bucket and evaporated it.Every time he evaporated a single liter of water, he got 20 liters which is 2 gallons. Since 20% is salt, the 2 gallons of evaporated water was 20% pure waterTo get that 2 gallons of salt, he had to buy 4000 ml of pure water1500ml of about 60% pure new water The answer is 7.9ml.question:#

The salt is 20% of the water, so 20% * 2 liters = 0.4 litersWhen all the water evaporates then that 0.4 liters becomes salt in salt-dry form. If 1 liter of water is 1000 ml, then the volume of salt-dry form is 1000/0.4 = 2000 mlThe answer is 2000.question:#

Assume that 2 liters of seawater evaporated in the heat, all of it has turned into salt. Thus, in those 2 liters we have 20% (or 2 grams) of saltHe collected 2 liters of salt in the bucketThe original mass is 2 gramsThe new mass is 2 gramsThe salt evaporated because it is at 100%  so the total mass does not changeThe 2 liters have left 2 grams of salt. So 2 grams of salt weighs and is equivalent to 2 liters.So 2 grams is 2 litersThat's why there is 2 liters of salt.The concentration of salt in the 2 liters is 20%Salt in 1600 ml weighs 200 grams. 1600 + 200 = 200x1600/.20 = 320x2000/10 = 4000gis/ml-> 4000*1000x100 Pascals = 0.4 N/1mlx80g => 320,000N/1 mlThe answer is 1.4 N per ml.#

12 liters of water should evaporate if it contains 20% salt.Now, $1 liter = \$1\$ $1000\ ml$ of water. 1 liter 20% salt = $20 \times 1000\ ml$ salt of 20% salt = $2\$ 2 = \$2 \times 10000\ \ \over = 200\ ml Now, his 500 ml = 50 ml of salt.The answer is $50 ml$.question:#

20*.20=2 liters of seawatercontain 1000 ml of water in total.He collects 2 liters in his bucket.When it's gone dry, that means there was no more water, so the remaining volume is just salt.2 liters of water is 1000 ml; 1 liter of water is 1000 ml of salt; or 1000 ml; and 2 - 1000 = 0.

The amount of salt in an ocean is 2000/1000=200 liters.Because the bucket is 2 liters, Jack will collect 200/2= 100 liters of ocean water.Because it is 20% salt, Jack will collect 100*.2= 20 liters of salt.The answer is 20 liters of salt.question:#

20 % is 1:4.So, 20% of 2 Liters is 20% * 200 ml = 40 ml of salt.Jack needs 40 ml * 8 = 320 ml of salt.Your answer is 320.Dear Read#
