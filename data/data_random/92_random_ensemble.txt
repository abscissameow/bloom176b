Sally: $6 * 30 = $180 month Bearing in mind that the days are months, and that is we know the amount of days, we can say that Sally has earned $6 * 22 = $132 year. Half of this is $64.Bob: $4 * 30 = $120 month Saving half of the money earned, Bob has $60.The total savings after a year is 64 + 60 = 114, the answer is 114.question:#

Sally makes $6 per day so she makes a total of $6*365 = 2085$ and saves half of it (50%) which is 1035$.Bob makes $4 per day so he makes a total of $4*365 = 1430$ a year and saves half of it (50%) which is 730$.The answer is 2085 + 1035 + 730 = 4380$.#

Sally makes $6 per day and she saves half of that which is $3. Then after a week she makes $6x7 = $42 half of that is $21So they have had 21 daysSally Spends $6 for a day, so $3 for 7 days difference between week to 42Divided by 365 days,42-(3/7)*365 = 1.0225The answer is $10.25question:#

If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, this means Sally will make a slightly higher number of days in total than Bob's.Sally will make pay days +[(6 * 10) + 4] * 5 = 5,000Bob will make pay from date- 6 * 10 + 4 * 5 = 3,500So, they will have 3,500 + 5,000 = $6,500It means 7900 days, have a centSo they have approximately 7,900 centsThe answer is 7,900.question:#

Bob and Sally each make $6 each day so they make $30 each day.A year has 365 days so it will take is 365/30 = 12.3 days to get to their vacationGetting half of that is 12.3/2.5=6.28.  We round that to just 6 daysForward 6 months and heres how many days there areAre there 180 days in 6 months?true because 180 = 6 months * 30 days180 divided by 6 = 30 and sorry folks we dont have 6 months with 31 days.That means if we do 180 days divided by 30 days we get 4 monthsSo 6 months is really 6 * 4 months = 24 monthsSo Bob and Sally are able to save $24/day = $720/day on the days they take shiftsworking a total of 12 * 180 = 2160 daysA month has 30 days so a year has (2160/30) = 74.2 monthsA year has 154 = 52 weeks and a week has 7 daysIf Bob and#

Sally makes $6*10/2=3$ per day after saving half of her babysitting earnings. Bob makes $4*10/2=2$ per day after saving half of his babysitting earnings.If they do this for twelve months, then:Sally makes $3*12/2=$6Bob makes $2*12/2=$12So they both have $12+24=$36 saved.The answer is $36.$Congratulations!! Thank you for playing a game with us!#

Sally earns $6 every day and Bob makes $4 every day so the mean money they make on an average day is $5. On an average day they have made 15 dollars.15 x 7 = 105So, Sallyâ€™s week average is $6x 7 = 42So, Sallyâ€™s total money earned is 42 * 5 = 210= 9 x $7 = 63.60Bobâ€™s average week is 4 x 7 = 28Bobâ€™s average $15 x 5 = $75 = $4 x 3.
