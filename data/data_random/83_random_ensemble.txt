20 + 0.8x24 = 4.4x20Therefore, Paityn has 0.8x24 hats = 19.2 hats.Zola will have 4x19.2 hats = 77.44 hats.Both will have 77.44 + 19.2 = 95.64 hats.Each will get 95.64 / 2 = 47.28 hats.The answer is 47.28.question:#

The required quantity of hats is 20 + 24 = 44. Since Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as she has, then: This is Paityn's relation to all red hats is 5 times. So, Paityn gets 5 of these 20 hats.The required quantity of hats is 20 + 24 = 44. Since Paityn has 4/5 times as many red hats as she has, then: This is Zola's relation to all red hats is 4 times. So, Zola gets 4 of these 20/25 hats.The required quantity of hats is 20 + 24 = 44. Since Zola has 2 times as many hats as Paityn has, then: Zola gets twice the number of hats as Paityn would get. So, Zola gets 44/2 = 22 hats.Zola gets 22 hats and Paityn gets 22 hats.The answer is 22 hats.question:#

Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats.Zola has 24/5 x 9/5 = 81 wears of hats.Paityn gets 41 + 10 = 51 hats.Zola gets 81 - 71 = 10 hats.The answer is 51 and 10.#

If we divide 46 hats equally between ourselves, I get 15 hats.Zola (4/5 x 15) + 14 = 23 hats Meena (5 x 23) - (2 x 15) = 30 hatsEach person gets 30 hats.Zola gets 23 hats.Meena gets 30 - 23 = 7 hats.The answer is 7 hats.question#

Dividing the total number of hats by 5 (Zola has 4/5 as many red hats as Paityn): 20+4/5 = 21 red hats for Paityn Zoles has 4/5 of 21 equal to 8 red hatsPaityn and Zola have 21+8= 29 red hats each.Dividing the total number of hats by 2 (Zola has twice as many blue hats as Paityn): 24+2 = 26 blue hats for Paityn Zola has 2 times 26 which is 52 blue hatsPaityn and Zola have 29+52 = 71 blue hats each.There are an additional 61 blue hats from all the hats. They have 29+52+61= 110 hats of each color.Paityn gets 29% of 110 equal to 29 hats Zola gets 29% of 110 equal to 29 hats or they would get the same amount.They each receive a total of 29x29+29h = 529 hats.The answer is 529.question:#

They combined all the hats together so there's 20 + 24 = 44 hats.They shared them equally so Zola should get 44/2 = 22 hats and Paityn should get 44 *.4 / 5 = 12 hats.The answer is 22 for Zola and 12 for Paityn.answer: The hour hand is moving a distance of 1 quarter circle towards the next number or amount#

Those who share hats equally will each get half as many hats as they have.(20 hats are shared between the 2 of them)Let’s label their hats (red hats and blue hats) with their names.They share hats all together and equally.Therefore, each split would be like below:1 red red hats  and 1 blue blue hatsLet’s make some calculations.Red Hats   Red Hats  -120/37Red hats are: 120 + (120/37) = 240 hats(The remaining 37  x 5 = 170 hats) all together.The blue hats are: 120/37 + (120-37)/37 = 120 hatsOrange Hats  (37 -120)/17 = 25 hatsPlum Hats  (37-120)/17 = 21 hatsOrange Hats  -(37/75)Red Hats  -120/37Red Hats  -(120/37) = 50 hats (Red hats only)(37 - 120)/37 = 2 red hats  (73  -(120/37))/37Blue Hats  + Red Hats  -2#

Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats: 20 + 24 = 44 hatsZola has 4/5 times as many red hats as Paityn and twice as many blue hats: (4/5)(20) + 2(24) = 38 hatsSince they are sharing them equally, there will be 44 * 1 / 38 = 48 hatsBecause the answer is not an integer, you have to find the nearest whole number you can.They count 48.5#

Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats. 20 + 24 = 44 hats.4/5 red hat was 20, 24 blue hats would be having 3 times as much as red hats, Royale had 20 (4/5),With respect to 4/5, royal would have 20 * 4/5 = 80 hats.Total number of hats was 20 + 80 = 100.100 shared between Paityn and Zola.Paityn got 100 25 = 40 hats.[]=A researcher was testing the resiliency of leaf cuttings. Initially she planted all of the cuttings in a sawdust medium ($90) and placed them under grow lights for 12 hours a day ($20). After 28 days, each cutting made two additional cuttings that were planted in the same medium for a second test. She later found out that the initial fixed costs and overhead were equivalent to $165 per cutting for the first test. For the second test#

As per what is requested, the number of blue hats Paityn has is 20 - 4/5 * 4 = 13 blue hats.The number of blue hats Zola has is 4 * 24 = 96 blues hats.Zola has twice the number of blue hats Paityn has, so the number of red hats Zola has is 13 + 4/5 * 96 = 38 red hats.The number of red hats Paityn has is 4/5 * 38 = 15 red hats.Based on those calculations, we know Zola got 96 + 38 = 124 hats, and Paityn got 120 + 15 = 135 hats.Each got 246 = 135 hats.The answer is 135. thank you. and happy new year. 那一年,这是一个#
