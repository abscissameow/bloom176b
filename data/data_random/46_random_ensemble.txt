Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes a day.The violin takes 3 longer to practice.The total time to practice piano and violin is 20 + 3 times age, 20 + 3 * 60 = 180Papa numbers, times that is 180/6 = 30 minutes divided by 4 weeks.So, 30 minutes a week means Carolyn practices For 30 minutes a week.The answer is 180 minutes divided by 6 times that is 180/4 = 45 minutes.60 times, 45 times a month is#

If the time for the piano= 20 min/day and time for the violin= 3 * 20 = 60 min/dayWe know that 3 * 20 = 60 minutes40 = 6 * 80, so there are 4 whole weeks per month (30 days).Therefore: 4 * 6 days * 20 minutes/day + 3 * 60 minutes/day = 4 * 6 days * (20 + 60) minutes/day.The answer is 400 minutes.question:#

7 days a week * 20 minute practice = 140 minutes a week4 weeks a month * 140 minute practice = 560 minutes a monthThe answer is 560minutes.question:#

Resolve the equation:20 minutes / practices a day(20 / 3) * practiced days / week(20 / 3) * 6 = practiced minutes a week(20 / 3) * 6 = 96 practiced minutes a month96 x 4 weeks = practiced minutes a month96 x 4 weeks = 4000 practiced minutes a month4000 x 4 weeks = 16,000 practiced minutes a monthSince Carolyn practices the piano for 6 days a week and the violin for 20 minutes a day, she practices the violin for 60 minutes a dayTotal practiced minutes a month / 60 minutes a day = days per monthSince 16,000 / 60 = 3.3333 treatment times a day = 3.3333 / 4 weeks = 0.8 rounds a monthThe answer is 1260 or 12 days a month.question:#

Carolyn practices for 20 minutes a day her piano (240 minutes a week), but practices 240/18=12 minutes each day she practices the violin. 6 days a week, she practices 240 + 360 = 600 minutes a week (720 minutes in total).If monthly, she practices 720 minutes/(4 weeks) = 240 minutes a week/(4 weeks) = 60 minutes a day of practice. The answer is 60 minutes a day.#

This is a bit tricky for me. We need to expand the first part of the equations a bit. To do so, we will multiply the violin minutes * 7 days/week. You can use a multiplication chart to help you. Carolyn practices the piano for 20 minutes per day and the violin for a minute * 7 days/weekSo her piano practicing is 300*6=1800 minutes/month. Her violin practice is 300*6 = 1800 minutes/month. So her total practice is 1800 minutes/month.The answer is 1800. question:"Mary is an ar#

 a a 20-minute practice session = 20 minutesA three times as long practice session = 60 minutes6 days a week x 3 sessions a day = 18 sessions (a day)4 weeks / 4 = days in a monthHence, Carolyn practices in a month: 20 minutes + 60 minutes (3 times as long) + 20 minutes a day = 120 minutes + 60 minutes = 180 minutes a month = 180 minutes * 4 = 720 minutesIn a month, she spends 720 minutes * 5 days = 3640 minutes practicing.The answer is 3640.question:#

20 minutes * 6 days = 120 minutesCarolyn spends 120 minutes * 30 = 3600 minutes in a month with 4 weeks3600 / 4 = 1080 minutesCarolyn spends 1080 minutes practicing the piano a month with four weeks.The answer is 1080.question:#

a) How many minutes a week do Carolyn spend practicing the piano: 20 minutes / day. for 6 days is: 20 x 5 = 100 minutes a weekThe total minutes a week Carolyn spends on practicing the piano and the violin combined is 100 + 300 = 400* After 4 weeks, it turns out that Carolyn spends exactly 1800 minutes on practicing music in order NOT to exceed the number of practicing minutes in 1 month with 4 weeksSo she spends 400 minutes a week practicing and we know she spends 400 minutes a week practicing.But there are 4 weeks which equals 1600 minutes a month and so for her to not go over this, she could practice for the extra time in minutes, more specifically, 1800-1600 = 200 minutesIf she practices 200 minutes OVER the 400, that would equal (200 / 4) = 50 minutes for each#

Carolyn has 20 minutes a day on the piano and 20 minutes a day on the violin. So, she has 20 * 6 = 120 minutes in one week.120 minutes/The number 5=480 minutesSo, Carolyn practices 480 minutes in a month with 4 weeks.12 minutes/The number of days in a week=524 minutesSo, Carolyn practices 524 minutes in a month with 4 weeks.The answer is 524.#
