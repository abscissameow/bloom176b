As stated in the question Aivo is older too Leon by 5 months. And Therese is two months older than Jolyn. If Leon is older too Therese by 2 months, Therese is older too Jolyn by 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 months.It means that Aivo and Therese are the same age. If Therese was 2 months older than Jolyn, it can be said that Therese and Jolyn are 3 months apart in age.The answer is 9.#

Therese is five months older than AivoTherese is 5 months older than AivoAivo is 5 months older than JolynTherese is 5 months older than Jolyn Therese is 5 months or 5/12=.417 years older than AivoTherese is 5 months older than AivoAivo is younger than LeonTherese is younger than LeonTherese is older than LeonTherese is older than AivoTherese is older than Jolynso Therese is older than Jolyn. Therese is younger than LeonTherese is older than AivoTherese is older than Jolyn Therese is older than Jolyn Therese is older than LeonTherese is older than Leon..
Therese is older than Leon. therese is older than therese. Therese is older than therese. Therese is older than therese. Therese is younger than therese#

Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, Therese is 5 months older than Aivo and Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. Therese comes first so x = 52*3 = 26Therese + 5 months = 3 + 26*5 = 61Therefore, Aivo is 61 - 26 = 35, Aivo + 2 months = 35 + 26 = 61and Leon is 61 - 35 = 26.Jolyn is 61 - 26 = 35.Jolyn + 2 months = 3 + 26) = 61The answer is 61.#

Therese is 5 months older than Aivo and Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. Therese is 5-2 = 3 months older than LeonSince the month Therese is used to make Jolyn age by twice what Leon ages by, Jolyn is 3*2 = 6 months younger than Leon.Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese and Leon is 5 months older than Therese. Thus Jolyn is (2 months older than Therese) - (5 months older than Therese) = 7 months older than Leon.Leon is 2 months older than Aivo and he is 5 months older than Therese and Therese is 3 months older than Aivo, so Therese is (5 months older than Leon) - (3 months older than Aivo) = 6 months older than ThereseTherese is 6 months older than Leon.Leon is 5 months older than Jolyn and Jolyn is 2 months younger than Therese.Jolyn is 6 months younger than#

Therese is 5 months older than Aivo Therese is 2 months older than Jolyn Aivo is 2 months older than Leon We know that Therese is 5 months older than T We know that T is 2 months older than Jolyn Therese is5 months older than Jolyn Therese is 2 months older than AivoAivo is 2 months older than LeonTherese is5 months older than LeonSo, Therese is 5 more months older than Leon. If we simply subtract 5 from 5 we get 30So, Therese is 3 months older than Leon.The answer is 3.#

Note: Therese is May born and Aivo is May born. Jolyn is June born. Leon is June born.Leon is 2 months older than Aivo ---> Leon = month `1`Aivo is 5 months older than Therese ---> Therese = month `5`Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese ---> Jolyn = month `2`Note: “is 5 months older than” = `month `5`“is 2 months older than” = `month `2`Just a mathematical rule: The older person is 1 + (x months). The younger person is x months.Aivo - Leon will be “the older one is 1 + (x months)“so = this leads to:Therese - Leon`: 5 months older thanTherese - Jolyn + Jolyn - Leon`: 2 months older thanLeon - Jolyn = `[Leon - Therese] - [Therese - Jolyn]`: (5 months older than - 2 months older than) Therese = month `3`will haveLeon - Jolyn = 333 months#

Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, so he’s 2 months older than Jolyn, and Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, Therese is 5 months older than Jolyn, Therese is also 5 months older than Leon, from Therese, we can say that Leon is 5 months older than Jolyn.The same can be said that Aivo is older than Leon by 5 months. Joleyn is older than Therese by 2 months.  Therese is older than Aivo by 5 months,Therese is older than Leon by 5+2=7 months so Jolyn is older than Leon by 5 additional months=7 months.So, the answer is 7.question:#

Therese – Aivo = 5 Therese – Leon = 2 Therese – Jolyn = 7 Jolyn – Leon = 5The older is Therese who is 2 months the 2 months the older Leon.  Therese - Jolyn = 7 and Leon - Jolyn = 5Therese - Leon = 5 then the older Therese is 7-5=2 Therese is 2 months older than LeonThe answer is 2.question:#

Draw their birthdays on a calendar together.So, Jolyn 2 months in front of Therese means that Leon is one fifth period older because the months are 5th periods.Therese 5 months in front of Aivo means that Jolyn is 4/5 period olderBecause the months are third periods, Leon is 2/5 period older.Jolyn is 2/5 + 1/20 + 4/5 + 1/20 = 3/5 period older than Leon because 2/5 + 1/19 + 4/5 = => 1/20 + 2/5 = 1/20 + 2/4 = 3/5. The answer is 3/5.A great place to practice!! Good luck#

Therese is 5 months older than Aivo.Therese is from month 6Since Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, Therese's month equals 6 plus 2 months.Jolyn is from month 6.Aivo is from month 6.Since Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, Leon is from Aivo's month which is 6 plus 2 months.Jolyn is from month 6.So 6 is equal to 6 plus 2 or 6 + 6 days.Jolyn is from 6 months ago, or 3 months ago.She is older than Leon by 3 monthsShe rarely is older by 2 monthsSo not at all answering, 6 is not older than 6So Leon is older than Jolyn by 6 months.The answer is 6.question:#
