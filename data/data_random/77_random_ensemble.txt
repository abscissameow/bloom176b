So 3kg was lost per month.Lets find how many kilograms at 4 months:Claro que foi durante 4 meses"---------->"We need to find the amount of weight that was lost per month:Donc 3kg /month.Multiply 97 *3 to find how many kilograms were lost.This is approximately 180 kgSo that he weighed 180 *4 =720kg.If you lose 180 kilograms and have 4 months, it will weigh 780 on the day of the fight.The answers are 780kg and 780kg.question:#

A boxer weighs 97 (kg) when he’s 4 months from the fight.3 (kg) is the amount that he loses per month.therefore: 97 -.3*4 = 92 (kg) on the day of the fightThe answer is 92kg.question:#

find a repeating pattern at the top.97 - 3 = 94 - 3 = 91 - 3 = 89 - 3 = 88 - 3 = 85 - 3 = 83 - 3 = 78 - 3 = 76The pattern has gone through 88 - 3 = 85 = 10 times.So the entire pattern is: 97 - 3 = 94.. 88.. 78.. 76.So when we multiply 86 by 4, we get 318.Therefore the answer is 318.question:#

We know that he started with 97 kg on the 1st. On the 2nd he weighs 97 - 90 = +7 kg. On the 3rd: 97 -(+2) = +3. On the 4th: 97 -(-1).9 = +7.4.99. On the 5th he weighs 97 - 0 = -24 kg,so we have 24 kg less than on the 1stThe sixth he weighs 97 + 24 = +102 kgAnd the seventh he weighs 97 -+2 = -99 kgThe answer is 102 kilograms.question:#

If x represents the number of months that have blown,We can use the formula Wf - (Wc x (2/n))where Wf = final weight of boxerWc = current weight of boxer), and n = the number of months until the day of the fight (n = 3).k = Wf - x x (2/n) = 97 - 3 x (2/n) (the change in amount of weight is specified per fixed number of months)97 - 3 x (2/n) = 97- 3 x 2 = 97 - 6 = 91.Insert x to get: x = (4m/31)(97 - 91) / 3m/n = 4/113m/3 monthsThe boxer will weigh 91 kg on the day of the fight.91 +11/4 = 91 +6.75 = 97/6.75 = 87.29 kgThe boxer will weigh 87.29 kg on the day of the fight. The boxer will weigh 87.29 kg on the day of the fight, with 3kg per month lost.The boxer will weigh 97 kg on 4 months from the battle. Therefore, the boxer weighs 97kg#

Over a 5 month time period, he will weight 97 – 3 = 94 kgAt this point, the fight is 4 months and 16 days away (5 months – 4 months and 16 days), so he has 4 months and 16 days to gain his own weight back+ 3 kg for the final weightgain of 97 kg at the fight.There are 30 days per month, so this would be (4 months and 16 days) * 30 days / 5 = 25 days So, 25 * 3 = 75 days = 5 months and 15 days.He gained weight 3 kg every month, and after 5 months and 15 days the fight is over.He weighed 94 kg and packed weight at 4 months and 25 days.The answer is 94 + 3 = 97 kg.question:#
