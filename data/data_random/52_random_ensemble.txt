5 x 8 = 40Pencils in box 10 x 10 = 1Averages:Total pencils for all of them: 10 x10 + 5 x8=55Replacement :On average, 7.2 pencil pieces are in each boxThe answer is 7.2.question:#

Arnel has 10 + 5 * 5 = 65 pencils in total.The five friends got five equal portions of the remaining pencils and got 8 pencils each;  8 / 5 = 1.6Pencils in each box will be one half of 65 because the number per box is an integer.65 - 1.6 * 5 = 27Pencils in each box is thus 27 / 2 = 13Pencils in each box will thus be 13 in each box.The answer is 13.question:#

He had ten boxes of pencils. In each box, he has ten pencils.He kept ten and shared the remaining pencils equally so in each of the other boxes, he kept 4/5 (or 80%) of the pencils.The number in each box is number of pencils in the box = ten/(80 percent) of the total number of pencils = 20/20 * 10 = 10The answer is 10.question:#

The number of pencils in each box is 10 + 10 / 5 = 16 pencils each box.In total there are 10 + 8 = 18 pencils remaining.The answer is 18.Question:#

What Arnel did is called equation: 10 = 10 + 8(n - 1)n - 1 = 10 * 8n = 16Therefore, 10 boxes of pencils contain 16 * 10 - 10 = 160 pencils.The answer is 160.question:#

If there are 10 pencils remaining, then 10 pencils have been shared amongst 5 friends.We know 10 pencils have been split 10 ways.  When 10 pencils are split in this way,  each box will receive 2 pencils.As we know 10 = 2 + 8, if we divide the number of boxes by 2, we will get 2 pieces, and if we double that, we will get 5 boxes.2 = 10 / 5 = 2 boxes/piece2 x 5 = 10 boxesThe answer is 10.question:#

There were 5 numbers: 10, 8, 20, 20, and 10. 18 made lots of possibilities, so we can consider 18 as the answer because the total 10 ['him'] is 10 * 2O ['his' and 'or' in English]. So the answer is 10 x 8 [2#

Marisa has 10 boxes of pencils = 100 pencils in 5 box, 20 pencils in each box.But she kept 10 + 5 = 15 of those pencils, then the remaining 25 = 5 boxes * 5 pencils each.Eight pencils is 5 times 3 pencils and this amounts to 3 boxes times 5/5 = 3 pencils.So, the five friends share five boxes of 5 pegs each, so they have 8*5=3x5=30 of that type of pencils.The answer is 5 pencils.1 - Gamedia69Part 2 question and#

In one box there are 10 - 2 = 8 pencils.In other words, 8 x 5 = 40 pencils divided equally between the ten.So 5 x 8 = 40, plus the initial 10 = 50 pencils were shared.Therefore, 5 x 8 = 40, plus the 10 pencils, is equals 50.The answer is 50 pencils.question:#

The number of pencils are held is 10 + 8*5 = 50.Each friend has 50/8 = 6.25 pencils.  But he doesn't count the 50 so he only get 4 friends, so his gotten pencils are 8*4=32.Total number of pencils get by Arnel is 50 - 8 + 32 = 100The answer is 100.Question: Raul had 5 posts on his#
