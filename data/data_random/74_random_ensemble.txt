We want to know how much weight were the last two passangers each lost (two of them lost the same weight).They lost 30 kilograms.The answer is 30 kilograms.#

Firstly we find the amount of weight each person lost, which is 104 kilograms of the total amount. The weight lost by the first individual was 103 kilograms - 27 kilograms = 76 kilograms. The weight lost by the second individual was 76 kilograms - 7 kilograms = 69 kilograms. The weight lost by the last two individuals was 69 kilograms - 69 kilograms = 0 kilograms.Each person lost a total of 76 kilograms + 69 kilograms = 135 kilograms.The answer is 135 kilograms.question:#

The total weight loss in kilograms is 104 + 103 + 103 + 103 = 318 kilograms.Each person was responsible for losing 103 kilograms. Thus, the total kilograms lost by each person is 103, 103, 105, 103, 103 = 563 kilograms.104 - 103 + 103 + 103 = 102 + 103 = 205 kilogramsAlex lost 27 kilogramsGreg and Emily lost the same amount so we have 105 - 103 = 8 kilograms lost by Emily.In this case, we have 322 - 205 + 8 = 97 kilograms lost by Kelly.The answer is 97.#

Let's say the 4 people that lose the weight where Sue, Tim, Ryan and Lisa.We know that Sue lost 27 kilograms.So  Sue lost 27/4=7.25 kilogramsSay Tim lost 7 kilogramso Tim lost 7-1=6.75 kilogramsThe two remaining people lost the same amount.Say Lisa and Ryan lost the same amount together.Lisa lost one fourth as much as Sue.Lisa lost 1/4*7.25=2.113748 kilograms Ryan lost the same amount, so he lost 2.113748 kilograms as wellLet's add up all of the lost kilograms.7.25 + 6.75 + 2.113748 + 2.113748 + 2.113748= 25.452749 kilogramsremember we did 103 kilograms from the question, plus the 25.452749 kilograms we are addinged went for 103+25.452749= 128.452749 kilograms.The questions helps us when we write the equation as the three people have helped with the weight loss.Each#

x = the number of kilograms lost by the first person (27kilograms). y = the number of kilograms lost by the second person (48 kilograms).Total kilograms lost = x + y (103 = 27 + 48)Total pounds lost = x + y ( or sideways fraction: 27 + 48)Dividing both sides by 2 (coefficient of x + coefficient of y )4x + y = 27 + 482x + y = 81The first person lost 27 kilograms and then the second person lost 48 kilograms minus the first person's 27 kilograms, which means 48 - 27 = 21 kilograms lost by the second person.So 21 is the number of additional kilograms lost by the second person over the first person. The 6 is therefore twice as many kilograms as the 21 kilograms lost by the second person.Therefore, y = 48 + 21#

The first person lost 27 Kilos.The first person lost 27 Kilos.The second person lost 27 -27-2*27= 3*27 = 81 Kilos.The third person lost 81*2 = 162 Kilos.The last person lost 103 -27 -81-162-2*162 = 5*162=2*27=81*2 = 162.The answer is 81 and 162.question:#
