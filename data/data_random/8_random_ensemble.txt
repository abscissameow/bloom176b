Alexis spent: $30 + $46 + $38 + $8 + $18 = $138so she has $138 - $16 = $122 left for the shoes.Now each item she bought cost a different amount, so we need to find one way to express the total she paid using one variable: $138 = 122 + the amount for one shoeThe amount for one shoe is: $138 - 122 because $138 is the total she spent and $122 is the amount left over.The answer is $118.Maria Belshaw is a Lecturer at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.#

$46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = ​ $129Because she spent $129, she must have spent $16 on something else.She can't have spent $16 on the shoes because that would be $16 less than $129, and her budget was $200. The shoes must have cost at least 16$, so at least, the price of the shoes is 16$The shirt cost $30.So, the shoes must have cost 17$, which means she spent $17 – 16 = 1$ more than the remaining $16.The answer is $170.question:#

The only thing she spent money on was shoes.She paid $38 for the suit, $15 for the pants, and $6.5 for the suit coatAssuming the shirt was $10, the total cost would have been $105She paid $18 for the belt.

The cost of the belt worked out to be $38-17 = $15.The answer is $15.question:#
