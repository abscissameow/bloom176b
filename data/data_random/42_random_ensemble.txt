If there were 9 hands in a break, each hand will have 1hand of 14 bananas + 9 hands of 9 bananas = 24 bananas per hand + 6 hands of 9 bananas = 54 bananas.Each monkey will receive 54 bananas.Each pile contains 24 + 25 = 49 hands, that is 4.9=9.2 hands.9 hands*1 hand*20 bananas + 6 hands*20 = 1*1.0*20 + 6*20 = 1080 bananasEach banana weighs 4 oz.asdSo there are 4 oz of 1080 bananas = 4 * 1080 = 4220 oz of bananas.The answer is 4220 oz.question:#

A hand can hold 9 bananas so a monkey needs 3 hands.So for the 6 piles with 9 hands each, the monkeys received 6 * 9* 3 = 162 bananas.For the remaining piles with 12 hands each, the monkeys received 12 * 9 * 3 = 216 bananas.So each monkey received. 162+ 216 = 328 bananas.The answer is 328 bananas.question:#

Each hand has 14 bananas.Each monkey gets 16 bananas.So, each monkey gets 14 x 12 x 16 = 1920 bananas in total.12 x 1920 = 2560 bananasIf 12 piles had 19 bananas total, each pile would have 19 x 12 = 228 bananas.Just 5 piles of banana each will suit this family of monkeys.Then 6 x 5 = 30 bananas totalSo, each monkey gets 30 bananas.That's the answer. But are you satisfied with this answer?#

There are 12 monkeys. Each of them gets 1/12*((10+6*14)/12)=2/7th of all bananas.Thus, each of them gets a total of 2*7/12 =2/7 + 1/12 = 1/14th of all bananas.The answer is 1/14.question#

A monkey gets (9 x 12) + (9 x 9) = 124 bananasThe answer is 124.question:#

Since each pile has 12 hands, and each hand has 9 bananas, each pile gives out 12*9= 108 bananasIf the monkeys had enough bananas, they would get 108*12 = 1296 bananas.So divide the bananas amongst 12 to get a banana for each of the 12 monkeys.There are now 12*1296 = 13568 bananas in total.Each banana is worth 12236/3134 = $41.03 so the monkeys are worth 13568*4103 = $59,342. Assuming no banana is left to countess the answer is 5.9842 million dollars that the#

Each pile has 13 hands with 8 bananas per hand.Six of the piles have 9 hands with 14 bananas on each hand.The other 4 piles have 12 hands with 9 bananas on each hand.There are a total of 6 x 9 x 14 + 4 x 12 x 9 = 602 bananas.Each monkey will get 602 divided by 12 = 50 bananas.The answer is 50.question:#

First find the number of hands there are: 12 monkeys * 12 hands/12 monkeys = 10 handsThere are 10 hands with 14 bananas/hand = 70 bananasThe 10 hands with 9 bananas/hand = 90 bananasThe 10 hands with fewer bananas have 74 fewer bananas than the 10 hands with 14 bananas.Therefore, there are 74 fewer bananas: 90 - 70 = 44Since each monkey got 44, the total number of bananas is 44 * 12 = 528 bananasThe answer is 528.question:#

Since each hand has 14 + 9 bananas, you just need to add them togetherwhich is 14 + 9 + 14 + 9 + 14 + 9 = 7A monkey needs to divide 7/12 = 0.58 A monkey needs. The answer is then 0.58 A monkey needs.
With enough repetition#

If the number of hands in each pile was proportional to the number of bananas in each pile, then 9 hands would have 9 x 14 bananas = 126 bananas and 12 hands would have 12 x 9 bananas = 108 bananas.Now, a total of 126 x 9 + 108 x 12 = 1452 bananas.On the other hand, 12 monkeys and 10 piles, so all monkeys would have 1452/10 = 144 bananas each.The answer is 144.2.Fill in the gaps to get the next#
