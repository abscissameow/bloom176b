Question reference  https://mathbrotherofque.xyz/question/17617.question by I_miracleGuess math. An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsed buildings while the previous earthquake, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed altogether?answer: 3.question:#

The third earthquake will have four times as many collapsed buildings as the original earthquake.Two buildings each collapsed due to the original earthquake, and four due to the second earthquake.Four of the original six buildings will still be standing, so a total of 8 buildings will have fallen.One more earthquake means that this will be eight + three new buildings = 11 collapsed buildings.The answer is 11.question:#

collapsing buildings = collapsed buildings after three more earthquakes = first earthquake * double of the collapsing buildings = first earthquake * 4earthquake Number of collapsing buildings1 5 2 10 3 20 4 4 4 total 4, 10, 20, 42 2 32question: Since state sales tax is 6 percent, and the gas pump price includes a 10 cent state sales tax, what is the actual price for 100 gasoline gallons?answer: In the first line, it's stated that the  gas pump price includes a "sales tax" and it lists that sales tax as 10 cents. Since the sales tax is 10% of the gas pump price, the gas pump price#

The number of buildings collapsed was:  4 – 1 – 2 – 4 = 7.The total time is 5 x 4 = 20 years.The total number of collapsed buildings in all of the earthquakes is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 17.The answer is 17.question:#

Consider them as a sequence as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.....Since, each number is twice that of its previous number so the sequence is geometric sequence This is { 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,...}Each number is the product of the first number and constant power of 2 which is 2 (base) so n = 2^0 = 1, n = 2^1 = 2 and so on.Therefore, the sequence equation is n = 2^k where k=1,2,3....,n (here k = 1, 2, 3)Now, at the n-th earthquake, consider each number as variable "n." Then the question will be: how much number of buildings will collapseThis is the same as given sequence {2, 4, 8...} after the "n-th earthquake."To this, the answer is 32 (just the first number starting from 1) since the first earthquake is 2 blocks on averageNow, to find out how many blocks collapsed#

1) The first earthquake caused 4 collapsing buildings2) After Earthquake 2, there will be 8 collapsing buildings, since Earthquake 1 doubled the number of collapsing buildings.3) After Earthquake 3, there will be 16 collapsing buildings, since Earthquake 2 doubled the number of collapsing buildings.4) And after Earthquake 4, there will be 32 collapsing buildings, since Earthquake 3 doubled the number of collapsing buildings.5) The first earthquake, Earthquake 1 caused 4 to collapse.6) Earthquake 1, doubled the number of buildings that collapsed to 8, a total of 12 buildings collapsed.7) Earthquake 2 doubled the number of buildings that collapsed to 16 and a total of 24 buildings collapsed.8) Earthquake 3 doubled the number of#

the authorities predict that each earthquake will result in 4 more collapsing buildings.Ten bridges collapsed in the first earthquake, so the second earthquake will have 14 collapsing buildings.The third earthquake had 28 collapsing buildings and the fourth had 56 collapsing buildings.Since the fourth earthquake is one more earthquakes than the first, we have: 4*3 + 10 + 28 + 56 = 124 collapsing buildingsThe answer is 124.

The  earthquake happened  so:4(1) =4 buildingshad the earthquake happen againso:4(2) =8 buildingsThird earthquake:4(3) =16 buildingsThe fourth earthquake:4(1) =4 buildingsFarasterner So that makes 316 buildings to collapseThe answer is 316.#

At time 1, 4 buildings collapse.At time 2, 8 buildings collapse, so 8/4 = 2 were added. again at time 3, so 4*2 = 8At time 4, which corresponds to 4 earthquakes, the total is 8+4+4=16 buildings.Answer is 16. question:"Mr#
