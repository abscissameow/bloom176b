He spends $5.00/$100 = 5% of his supply costs on his lawn work each month (rather than 20%); therefore, he needs 21 lawn/month to save enough to afford to play baseball all year.This looks like this: __________120% * 20% = 120% * 1/5 = 30%$30 / $120 = 25%$2 * $10 / $100 = 20%$100 / 4! = 40%This is how many dollars, on average, __________ does __________ do each month.Erin cleans rent-free, but she asks for $50#
