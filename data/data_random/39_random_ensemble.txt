Anna gets 2 × 14 = 28 pieces of candy on one subdivision.Billy gets 11 × 75 = 775 pieces of candy on another subdivision.The number of houses where Romeo trick-or-treat was 211 so the number of houses in Anna's subdivision: 100 + 14 × 55 = 608.So, the number of houses of the other subdivision: (608 + 75) / 2 = (608 + 150) / 2 = 75 ÷ 2 = 37.APA Citation format:Get the Answers to Quizzes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10FormID:1270:ef1b9765-1edd-e211-80ff-dc42d8a187a2Name::elliotNameID:ed0a1fc3-bbf9-7a26-932d-ed02d988dc8aSid::ef1b9765-1edd-e211-80ff-dc42d8a187a2:Question 2Yes, but expansion costs are changing2Question 411: PagesFigures72Figure 1Fig.Figure 2Fig.#

_________________ * 74 = ___________________We know that the first subdivision has 60 houses and the second 285 houses.Let x be the number of houses between these two subdivisions, so 60 + x = 75Let n be the number of houses in the second subdivision (so 75 = x + n).So Anna got 14 * 75 = 1020 pieces of candy Billy got 11x = 1020 x = 33⅓ and x + n = 7533⅓ + 75 = 150, so n = 65 Anna gets (70 + 33⅓) + 65 = 152, 165 more pieces of candy.The answer is 165.#

Trick or TreatingIf there are 60 houses and 14 candies per house, there are 60 x 14 = 840 candies. There are 840 candies and if Billy gets 11 candy pieces, she has 840-128 = 652 candiesLet me write out the same expression with candy numbers. Anna has 60 houses so 60 x 11 = 660 candies - her brother gets 11 so he has 650 candiesSo Anna had 14 candies per house so she has 2 more candies than her brotherBilly's number is greater than Anna's number so Billy has more candy than Anna.Billy gets 11 candies per house so the number of houses is 75 and Billy has 11 candies per house for a total of 75 x 11 = 795 candy piecesAnna's number is greater than Billy's number so she has 2 more candies than BillyBilly had 650 candies - Anna#

14 pieces of candy / house * 60 houses = 840 pieces of candyThe number of pieces of candy Billy gets in the neighboring subdivision is 11 pieces of candy / house * 75 houses = 825 pieces of candyAnna gets 840 pieces of candy - 825 pieces of candy = 25 pieces of candyThe answer is 25.question:#

60 housesAnna gets 14 pieces of candy per house so she gets 60 x 14 = 840 pieces of candyTotal = 840 + 360 = 1140 pieces of candyTherefore, Anna gets 1140 -30 = 1100 pieces of candy.So, one house has 60*1100 = 65,200 pieces of candyThe answer is 65,200.question:#
