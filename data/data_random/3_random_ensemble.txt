Julie is reading a book with 120 pages and she has already read 12 times.She read 12+12 pages yesterday.We have to find the half of the remaining pages:120 – (12+12)2=482So the half of the remaining pages is 48.The answer is 48 pages.question:#

After reading half of the remaining pages, she will have read half of 120 - 12 = 108.To complete 108 by reading twice as many pages is to read 108 / 2 = 54 pages.So, in total, she would read (12 + 90) = 102 pages.Thus, she should read each day (102 / 3 - 12) = 35 pages.The answer is 35.question#

if she wants to read half of the remaining pages, then 2 times half of the remaining pages is half of the remaining pages, as pictured below.Half of remaining pages = 120-120/2=60 pages.= 12 pages per day = 12/5 days.So, she should read 12 pages of the book tomorrow.The answer is 12. ধন্যবাদ#

1/2 of 120/2 = 60 pages, so she should read 60/120 = 1/2 of the remaining pagesUse the fact that lirey read 1*2 =2 pages more yesterday, she can read 1*2 =2 more pages tomorrow. Her goal is to remain halfway through the book.Time the remaining pages using the info that she read 1*2 =2 pages more yesterdayThere remain 1*2 =2 times as many pages to go = 2y2The 1/2 that Julie is looking for is the MAX of 12 and 2y2, so the 1/2 is MAX(1/2 & 1/2) =12 secondsHireHirePositive integer questions and answersHirePositive integer questions and answersPositive integer questions and answersPositive integer questions and answersPositive integer questions and answersPositive integer questions and answersPositive integer questions and answers#

So, Julie has read (12 + 12) pages in two days.If she wants to read (120 - 12) Pages. (120 - 12)/(12 + 12) = (120- 12)/10 = 10 pages.So, Julie has read 12 + 12 + 10 = 30 pages.The answer is  30 pages.question:#

Let's calculate how many pages Julie has read so far. If she was able to read 12 pages yesterday, yesterday she read 12 pages and 12 + 12 = 24 pages total. This means she has 24 – 12 = 12 pages remaining. Then out of the remaining pages she has to read half.The half of 12 pages is 6. Therefore, she needs to read 6 pages and there are 12 pages remaining. So out of 12 pages she will need to use 6 more. This means after reading 6 pages she will have 6 + 12 = 18 more pages to read, which will become 18 – 6 = 12 remaining pages to read.There are 12 remaining pages. Out of these remaining pages, she will have to read half. The half of 12 is 6. So she is able to read 6 more pages as needed. The page count to the solution is 12 * 12 = 144.The answer#

The equivalent problem involving fractions is 120 / 2 = 60Today, the pages that Julie read were 60 + 12 = 72 pages.12 was half of 24 pages yesterday.Julie can't read half of 24 pages.Julie must read half of 72 pages, which is 72 / 2 = 36 pages.The answer is 36.question:#

We know her book has 120 pages.Julie read 12 pages yesterdaySo 120 - 12 = 108 Julie read 24 pages today24 / 2 = 12 pagesAfter that Julie has 56 pages remaining56 / 2 = 28 pagesJulie should read 28 + 12 = 40 pages. Notice that 56 - 28 = 18 pagesSo there are 18 pages remaining.The answer is 40.question:#

Disregard the three first days:Divide the amount of pages she read in Yesterday by the number of days she remained in the book reading minigame. That is, 12 pages / 3 days = 4 pages/day.Find the number of pages she read today: 4 pages/day * 2 days = 8 pagesDivide the number of remaining pages she has to read by the amount of pages she read today: 120 pages - 8 pages = 112 pages(I started with 120 pages because the 120 pages indicate total number of pages remaining, and the 8 pages indicate how many pages she read today (4 pages/day * 2 days = 8 pages). This equation is found in the question, but I used it here to better understand it.)Divide the number of remaining pages by the amount of days she needs to read: 112 pages / (3 remaining days -1) = 23 pages#

If Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she needs to look at half of the 120 pages, which is 60 pages.Julie read 12 pages yesterday, which means she will need to read 15 more pages in order to get to 60pages.Julie can read a 12 page book every day, meaning she reads 12*12 = 144 pages per week.144 pages / 60 days = 24 pages per week.Julie will need to read 24 pages everyday.Julie will need to read 24 * 2 = 48 pages.6/12 * (120-120/12) = 60 pages.The answer is 60.question:#
