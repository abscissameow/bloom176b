48 is the total amount of water required for both fish tanks.Gail has 48 gallons/2 gallons = 24 two-inch fish in the first tank.She has 48 gallons/3 gallons = 16 three-inch fish in the second tank.She has more three-inch fish in the first tank because 24 is larger than 16.The answer is 16.question:#

We need to find the difference of the number of fish in the first tank and the number of fish in the second tank. 48*2 gallons in the first tank = 96 gallons 96*3 = 288 gallons 288*2 = 576 gallons 5 *inch size of second tank = 12 inches 12 * 3 = 36 inches 576 - 36 = 540 gallonsFirst tank has 540*2 = 1,080 fish and second tank has 1,080*2 $3 number of fish only $3 = $3 fish in second tank 540 - $3 = $3 fish in first tankThe first tank holds $3 more fish than the second tank.question: A circle is cut into thirds by three intersecting lines. The areas of the sections were 125, 250, and 625 square units respectively. What is the area of the triangle that is the intersection of the first two lines?answer: We need to find the area of the triangle.We know#

We need to find how many fish would Gail have in the first tank if one of the 1.5 inch fish in the first tank eats another.Let's call the gambled fish to the tank - FrankIf we know that the total amount of fish in each tank is the same (48 x.6- rounds the fractions – the tanks are equal fractions of each other), we can solve for Frank. He is 2-third of the fish in the tank.So, 2 * 3-inch fish * 3/2 gallons/each tank = 4-inch tank * one gallon/12 inches So, one-third of 120 gallons is 40.Frank = 40/48 = 2 inchesThe number of inches in the tank is = 40 inches * 3 inch fish:48 * 2 inches = 48, we find two inches in tank number oneAdd the inches we find so far up half way (48/2 = 24 inches)That is 40 + 24 =734 inchesThere are 734 inches of fish in tank#

The two-inch fish would go in the first tank, and the one-of tank fish (which eats the two fish).The two-inch fish has 16 inches of fish, or 8 gallons.Using the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, the first tank has 8 rings of fish.The third tank has 24 rings of fish.Under the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, the third tank has 24 rings of fish.So, the first tank is overfilled twice as many times as the second one.The calories in one-half tank of overfilled water are: 1 x 48 x 1.6 x 4 x 4 = 1504 calories.The calories in one-half tank of overfilled water are: 1 x 24 x 3 x 4 x 4 = 784 calories.Using the same number of fish in the two tanks, the answer is 1504.The answer is 8 more fish in the first tank than the tank.question#

There are two fish in the first tank while there are one fish in the second tank.Let n be the number of fish - 2 and m be the number of fish - 1 in the first tank.Gail tells us that he would have 2m gallons of water per n inches of fish. She holds that 2m times the number of fish in addition to 1 gives the number of gallons of water in the first fish tank.m+ 2n-1 = Vwhere, V is a variable for the number of gallons of water per n inches of fishFor n = 2, the first equation reduces to 3m = 2n+1For n = 3, the first equation reduces to 4 m = 4 +1Matching the variables in the first equation for n = 2, the second equation becomes1 + 2m = 3mThe second equation can now be solved to give m=1For n=3: 1#

4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 64 since that's the pattern 4s followed by 3s followed by 2s folllowed by 1s, which is equal to 64.The answer is 64.question:#

There are 72 inches in a 48 gallon tank, so she needs 72 fish in the second tank, half-sized 3-inch fish.The first tank has 72*2 because it's twice the size.She needs 72 fish in the first tank, three 2 inch fishThe fish jump from one tank to another, so while 72 jump in the first tank, only 48 jump to the first tankTherefore there are 48-72=-24 fish on the first tankTo answer the question, if one fish eats another, the remaining n fish - 1 fish = fish that eat remaining fishTherefore fish = fish-1The answer is 24fishThe answer is 25.

In the first tank, 2x3x3 = 18 fish are 3 inches tall.There are 48 x 1 = 72 gallons of water in that tank.In the second tank, 2x2x3 = 12 fish are 2 inches tall.There are 24 x 1 = 24 gallons of water in that tank.Since each fish requires one gallon of water, the first tank supports more fish than the second tank at 72 fish proudly present our math solver app and hope it qualifies your search.
