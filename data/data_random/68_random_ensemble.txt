Elsa has 10 coins for every 45 coins that Amalie has.The ratio is 10:45. So 10/45 = 0.22.Amalie spent 3/4 of what she has, so she spent 0.8 of the wholeSo, 0.22x 0.8 = 0.18 coins for Amalie.We know that the total coins previously is x + 0.18 = x + 70.18The number of remaining coins for Amalie is x = 275The answer is 275.#

Let x be the number of coins Elsa has and y be the number of coins Amalie hasElsa has 10 coins x + 45 coins y = 440 coinsAmalie has 10 coins x + 45 coins y = 440 coinsElsa spends 3/4 of the money she has on toys which means 3/4 of x + 3/4 of y which would mean 7/10 of x + y = 26/5 = 6 coinsElsa spent 1 of her coins so x-1 = 59/4 = 16 coinsAmalie did not spend any money so letâ€™s find how many coins Amalie hasAmalie has 16 coins16 coins x and 16 coins y = 16 (1 less than 60) coinsSo x = 60 and y = 1x + y = 61 80 80% of the 664 = 71 coins are spent on toys so there are 571 = 11 coins left for AmalieThe answer is 11.question:#
