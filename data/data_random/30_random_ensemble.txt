25% of 3 * 4 = 12  25% of 3 * 5 = 7.5  Bill + Dale = 30 * 4 * 50 = 1,600  Ann + Cate = 30 * 5 * 75 = 3,700  Total = 2,450  We know that Bill and Dale eat 50% of pizzas (1,600 / 2,450 = 50%).  75% of 3 * 5 = 23.75  Ann + Cate = 30 * 23.75 = 7,050Bill And Dale Eat (mean value)= (1,600/2).(50%)/4000 = 2000  Ann + Cate Eat= 7,030  75 % of 5 is 375Ann, Bill and Cate each eat the specified percent of their pizza leaving 3,030 pieces of pizza uneaten. In other words if Bill, Dale and Chris each ate the same percent of pizza pieces they each would have eaten 3,030 - (- the proportion they ate) * 5 pieces of pizza  ex Bill ate 10% of the pizza so there would be 1,030 pizza pieces left if Bill ate the same amount of pizza pieces as the same computer...The answer is 1,030.#

question:#

- Bill and Dale's personal pan pizzas are cut into 4 pieces, so they eat 2 pizzas making a total of 2 * 4 = 8 pieces of uneaten pizza. Ann and Cate's personal pan pizzas are cut into 4 pieces, thus they eat 2 pizzas, making a total of 2 * 4 = 8 pieces. The total number of pieces eaten is 8 * 2 = 16 pieces. The number of pizza pieces left unaffected is the number of pieces not eaten 16 - 8 = 8 pieces.The answer is 8 pieces of pizza.question:#
