The fact that the total money is $28 $28$ shredded into  seven $1$'s tells us that $28 = 7\cdot 1 + Esta equals 7 plus twice some other number"Because there are 28 total dollars, the number of septuples is 28/7, which is equal to 4.7, because 28 divided by 7 is approximately "4.7", a rational number."The dollar that the dog got ahold of was the even dollar, so there were two even dollars. This tells us that the dollars that were shredded were 6 pennies, 2 nickels, a dime, a quarter, and a dollar. Because the total was $1.00, the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters was 0.06 cents multiplied by 6 forms $1.00"So Leah has 29 cents.$28 - 29 = 1 The answer is 1 centsI entered a different blog with a similar quiz, and it worked fine.

Leah had $1 left after she shredded her wallet so lost $1 of the money.Leah worked odd jobs around the neighborhood for 2 weeks. 28 ÷ 7 = 4.5. We spend 1/7 of any earnings. $28 = 4 x 7 + 1.4 x 7 = 28 x 7 / 7.28 x 7 / 7 = 16.56. 16.56 - 1 = 16.55.The $1 went into savings and than was spent on a milkshake, so there is no money left in savings.Leah couldn't have lost $1 she gained it.She got 16.55 + 1 = 16.55.The answer is 16.55.question:#

> The shredded money adds up to $26, so Leah originally had $26.She spent a seventh of it on a milkshake, or $28 / 7 = 4$So she put 4$ in her savings account - 1$ of the now shredded money $21So her wallet left with $21$ from the original $26$So, Leah originally had $26 - ($26 / 4) + ($26 / 2) = 1.$The shredded money leaves her with 1dollarThe answer is 1$I can add two more, for every 10th answer I can add one.#

28 / 7 = about 4.5If she wants to buy a milkshake, she can buy 4.5 milkshakes.If she doesn't use her $7, she can save $1 on one of the remaining milkshakes.So, she spent 7 - 4.5 = 2.5 dollars and her wallet had 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 dollars.She lost 3.5 - 1 = 3.5 dollars.The answer is 3.5.#

Total money = 28 – 1/7(milshake) – 1/2(saved) – 1(remainder)= 24 – 1 – 1/2 – 1 = 4Total money = 28 – 6= $22Leah lost her total money which was 22 – 4 = 18Dollars lost = 18 – $1 = 17The answer is 17.question:#

$28 - $7 (milkshake) - $15 (half of the rest), left $27How much left in her wallet before the dog ate itis - 27/7 = 4So, how many did she lose is - 27 - 4 = 23The answer is 23.question:#

The first part of the puzzle is to find how much was left in Leah's wallet. Let Y represent all the money in Leah's wallet before the dog got ahold of itY = $28 - $7 = $21Since Y = $21 and Y = 21 * 11 / 1,Y ≈ 21The amount tha the dog shredded was (Y - 1) because it mixed up and shredded 11 / 1 of the moneyLeah lost a total of Y-1 = 22.Let x be the amount Leah lost.Since all the money was either left untouched or shredded, 2 + x = 21Leah lost (21 - 21)/2 = 1 dollarLets continue the problem:Leah saved (28-1)/7 = 5/7 of the money that stayed. 1 * 21 = 21 dollars and 2/7 = 5/72/7 = 21 dollars so (28-1)/7 = 1And went to the store and bought a $7 milkshake. Since (28-1) = 27 and 21+2/7 = 7. Shows Le#

Therefore, there is $5.5 remaining.The next part of the problem says that she puts $2.3 = 0.3 seventh of her money into her savings.  Reconciling this with the first answer, she put $1.2 into savings making the money she put into savings $5.5 - $1.2 =#
