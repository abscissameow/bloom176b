Tara can pay $65 a month for 4 months, so her payments will be $255. However, since a $20 down payment is needed, her total payments will be $655. Her outstanding balance will be $1000-$655 = $355 after paying the 4 months. The answer is $355.question:#

So if she has $1000, the down payment is 20% quarter of the expense for the cost of the laptop.So she's paying $1000 -.2*$1000 (down payment) = $800For the first month, she will be paying $65 * 4 (the amount of the days) = $260  Then for the third month she will be paying $65*3 = $195Then for the fourth and final month she will once again be paying $65 * 4 = $260So, the total amount of money she has to pay is 260 + 195+  70+ $260 = $795The answer is 795.question:#

Tara has to pay $240 by the end of the 0rder of months because 1000 / 4 = 250So Tara needs $240 / 65 = 3 payments = 10 months.This makes Tara need to pay $10 per month for 12 months because 12 * 10 = 120In the first month, Tara will need to pay $120 because 10 * 11.25% = 12%So she will need to pay $43 per month because 120 / 12 = 10310 / 6= 13.3 / 4 = 43The answer is 43.question:#

If Tara makes $20 down payment, and based on her statement that $20 is an additional payment, her initial balance is $1000 - $20 = $980.With the 20% down payment, $980 - 20% = $196 for the remaining installment payments of 12 months.Her payment per month is for $65 / 12 = $5. Thus her payment and balance for every 4 months can be calculated below.Before PPMTMonthMonthBalance Month4Balance Initial Publisher - Learning is Fun 2020

20% of 1000 is 200.So you know that after 4 months, 200*65$50000000000000*1000=$160000However, if Tara chooses to pay $200 as a down payment: $200*65*$800100% of 1000 is $1000You can subtract the two to find that Tara will pay $160000-$10000=$150000The answer is $150000.quiz topic2:#

after one month    balance = 1000 - (20/.65) = 994.10 after two month    balance = 994.10 - 20 + (20/.65) = 902.40 after three month    balance = 902.40 - 20 + (4/.65) = 838.74 after four month    balance = 838.74 - 20 + 20 = 746.44Final    balance is 746.44 - 20 = 646.44The answer is 646.44.Michael EarleyEnd of Fifth Grade End of Fifth Grade.#

This requires calculating 20% of the full cost.1000 x 20% = 200Usually a down payment will be required for which 20 of the 200 will be for the down payment, so she needs to pay 180 for 4 months.180 x 4 months = 720$The answer is 720.#

By paying this additional $20, Tara will be paying $20 + $1000 * 20% = $220. Since she will be paying for 4 months, she must make an additional 4 x $65 = $260. Her total payment for four months will be $260 + $220 = $520. Her balance must be $1000 - $520 + $20 = $340The answer is 340.question:#
