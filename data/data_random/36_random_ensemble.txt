[Lisa - 20%] + [20% - Tommy] = 10%Below is Elsa’s table. The scores shown are from a recent Math achievement testing. Elsa found it interesting, that most of the students in her 11th grade class received 90% or higher.machine scoreElsa plans to use this table in showing that her school has a ‘World Class Belts’ program. Based on these results, Elsa plans to assign the students to two yellow belts and two green belts.she fastforwarded the 3% score for the student who missed the 4th grade thus creating the new table if students fastforwarded with scores incurred by obviously the data is created with green belts but the school chose to allocate the students equally.Question 6The score for the student were shifted to the 30% score the 98%#

Lisa earned $60 and Tommy got half of what Lisa earned. Since $60 is twice as much as $30, $60/2 = $30 and ${30}/2 = $15.Lisa earned whatever Tommy earned, but she earned it twice.$60 - $30= $30; 30 + $15 = 45.The answer is 45.question:#

If $60 was earned by washing, $60 = 2 x $30.$30 = 1/2 x $60.Yeah so Lisa's earnings are $60/2 = $30, and Tommy's are $30 - $60/2 = $15.More Lisa : $15 vs nothing for Tommy.The answer is $15.#

Tommy earned 30Because Lisa earned half of what they earned, then $\frac{\text{amount Jack earned}}{\text{amount Jack earned}} + \frac{\text{amount Lisa earned}}{\text{amount Jack earned}} = \frac{60}{60}$Or $30 + \frac{30}{60} = \frac{24}{60}$, which we can multiply together to get $\frac{24}{6}$Lisa earned $\frac{24}{6}$ as much as Jack.Jack earned $24 and Tommy only earned $30, so Lisa earned $24 - 30 = $4 more than TommyThe answer is $4.All of today's questions can be found here.#

Jack washed cars for $60.00Lisa washed cars for $60.00 To get half of that money is $37.50Tommy only washed money half as much as Lisa = $36.00Lisa - Tommy = $37.50Lisa - ( Lisa + Jack) = Jack = $60Jack - $37.50 = 24.50Other way of solving the problem:So the money earned by Lisa is lisa=$60.00Tommy is T.=$30.00Lisa - T. = $37.50So the difference is (Lisa - T.) - (T. - Lisa) = $0Jack - Lisa = 24.50The answer is 24.50.question:#

In this word problem, they describe that half of $60 was earned by Lisa, So the $60 can be broken up into halves.The halves will be $60 ÷ 2 = $30, since half of $60 is $30. $60 - $30 = $30 is earning by Lisa.Each of that applies to Tommy: $30 ÷ 2 = $15, since half of $30 is $15. $30 - $15 = $15 is what Tommy earned.Lisa earned more money than Tommy.The answer is $1.5.The tricks given above will help you to give proper answers to the questions#

Lisa has earned ($60 + 5 = $65)Tommy has earned  ($60 – 5 = $55)Lisa earned ($65 - $55 = $10)The answer is $10.question:#

Lisa's total is equal to half of the $60.So her total is half * 30, which equals $30.Tommy's total is equal to half of one-half of the $60.So his total is one-third * 30 = $10.Since Lisa earned $30 more, she earned $60 - $10 = $50 more than Tommy.The answer is $50.question:#

The total money earned is 60.Lisa earned 2/3 of the money. Hence, she earned (2/3)*60=40.She earned 40 less than 160, which was Tommy's earnings.Her earnings equaled 160.The answer is 40.question:#

First, find the difference between what Lisa earned and the total amount: 60$ Fraction = £20. On the other hand, find the difference between what Tommy earned and the total amount: 60$ Fraction = £30.Therefore, the total difference is $30 minus $20 = $10.The answer is $10.CONSTRUCTING THE SUSAN MAMIASCIENCE SQUAREQuestions#
