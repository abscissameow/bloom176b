The extra items also cost $45 on Thursday. The credit remaining is $100 - $15 - $45 = $50The credit limit can be rewritten as 100=$100 - $15 + $45= $50Therefore, the remaining credit is $50.The answer is $50.question:#

By Tuesday, she spent the full $100.After that, 4 * 23 = 92The total of Tuesday and Thursday is 15 + 4 = 19The net amount on Saturday is 100 - 92 = 8By that time, 8 + 92 = 100Therefore, 4 * 23 + 92 = 102Although 102 is eight dollars short, that dollar can be taken off on Monday so that she adds it to 192The answer is 102.question:#

He gets her credit a week beforeJust do the math for that weekMary buys $123 on TuesdayMoney paid: $123 - $100 reimbursement = $23 on TuesdayMoney spent after Tuesday: $147Money spent on Thursday: $15 = $147 - $123 (including the break she gets)Money still left: $100 - $100 = 0 overageHere is how it works.Tuesday $147 + $23 + $100 = $23 + $123 + = $300Thursday $15 + $123 + = $123 + $100 + = $200 Thursday the Excess = $231This is the excess money she can't spend on Saturday. She has $123 of that until Saturday.She can't spend more than $5 each day = $100 over 5 = $25 a dayBut she wants to spend 0 on the next weekSo she must play $25 over 5-5 = 0 daysOver $5 each day for 0 days = $0So She just uses her $100.The answer is 0.question:#

The credit is 100 dollarsSince she spent the full credit limit that week, 100-15+23= $80 is left.Mary has to pay 80 dollars, leaving her with no more creditBut since she was already using 100 dollars up previously, there is nothing left for next timeSince she spent 100 dollars and 100-15+23= 70 when paid $15 and $23, she must have spent another $15 in between so that 100-15+15=100 dollar spentSumming up those three times, Mary paid 3 time for mailing again before being over3 times 100 = $300, leaving her with nothing for next timeThe answer is 0.question:#

Mary cannot possibly spend all of the store's credit limit without breaking the condition that she must pay it all in full before her next shopping trip on Saturday, surely this $15 plus whatever amount she spent on Saturday can't equal the store's credit limit?The credit limit is $100.So:  25 - 15 = $110 - 15$100 for Saturday plus $15 * 5 days does not equal $100 for Sunday.The answer is 110.$120$-------------  more to add here.#

If we see Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday as saturday where m- monday, t- Tuesday....... Then she has $2200-4900+12000+13400+15500 so total purchasing would be $4000. The deal was she will be getting paid twice as much as money spent.So the next purchase needs to exceed the losing credit limit of $4000, so that if she pays $1500, the total sum of purchase will be $4500, total weekly cost, So she will be getting $1200 as her double.Some questions may have been wrong and some may have been wrong from my textbook and others may have been alright I had some time constraints studying for a big exam so I cannot double check.
