Since Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile on the first three days and Mia also averages (2/3) of a mile over the first 4 days. The final three days they have to run 30 * (2/3) + 30 * (2/3) * 2 = 30 * (1/2) + 30 * 2/3 = 30 + 18 = 48 miles.48 miles divided by 3 days is 16 miles.So each day they have 16 miles to run and the average per day each day is 16 miles.The answer is 16.question:#

On the first three days Jesse averaged (2/3) of a mileMonday: 3 miles Tuesday: 3 miles Wednesday: 3 milesThursday 3*0.7*0.75=2.58 milesSaturday 10 milesMonday: 3*1.75=3.75 miles.Wednesday: 3*2.75=5.5 milesFriday: 3+3.75+5.5+0.75divided by 4=5 milesSo, on day 5 plus day 6, Jesse averages (3.75+10.75)/2=5.5 milesOn day 4, Jesse ran 10 miles table.Monday: 3 miles Tuesday: 3 milesWednesday: 3 miles Thursday: 1.25 (0.75 + 0.5) milesFriday: 3+3.75+5.5+day 4=0 milesFriday: 0+8= 9.25 miles The road on day five MilesAnd Mia's route of the final 3 days was divided by divisionAlso, the total mile Miles is both of them subtracted from (30-3) milesThe final mile journey between Mia's final 3 days were divided by both of themAs a result#

There are 7 days in the whole competition Jesse has participated in 3 daysThe first 3 days, Jesse has run a total of cara / 3*3 days / 3 =3 days = 9 miles.The next 3 days he will have to run a total of 10 miles.Therefore,The average of their average = 3 days × 9 miles + 3 days × 10 miles = 9 + 10 = 19.The answer is 19.question:#

1) Jesse is averaging ((2/3) * 4 = 3 miles for the first 3 days, and 10 miles on day four. For the final 3 daysJesse is averaging: (3 + 7 + 10) / 3 = 6 miles over the final 3 daysThe answer is 6.question:#

In order to find the average they have to run over 3 days, we need to find their average for 4 days: Average (0.67 + 3 + (3/10)) = (0.67 + (3 + 0.7) ) = 4.3 miles.After they have run 4 days, the race director leaves one more day for both to meet the week's requirement: 30 miles, which is also the exact distance from home school to home school.But Jesse is ahead of Mia by 4.3 miles over 4 days. So if Mia has to run 4.3 extra miles it will take her 2 days instead of one.thus the final three days is 4(4) + 4.3(2) = 28 milesIn the last 3 days the average is 28 * 4 / 3 = 10. 3 milesThe answer is 10.question:#

Jesse: 7/3*30 = 20 milesMia 6*4 = 24 milesSince they have to run 30 miles, 10 miles must come from whatever Mia normally does. 1.8*Mia’s usual daily distance = 10 miles.Mia’s usual daily distance = 3*4 = 12 miles.Mia: 24 / 1.8 = 13.1 more miles to be run.The solution is 13.1 miles to be run for the remaining 3 days.The solution is therefore 48 miles as a total to be runover the week.They just need to average a little over 9 miles a day over the final 3 days.The answer is 9.6#

They average over the first 7 days because Jesse does 3 days and Mia does 4 days, Jesse does (2/3) miles / 3 days = (2/3) miles and Mia does 3 / 4 days = 3 milesTheir average can be (2 + 3): 4 = 6 &frac12; miles over 7 daysThe grand total will be 30 miles - (6 &frac12; miles) = 24 &frac12; milesThe answer is 24 &frac12; miles.question:#

It's 4x ~ 5x▲ ∶ 6 + x▲ = 30 milesEach of the first 4 days takes 4x miles on average so 24 miles (3x) + 4 miles raw = 30In order for the final 3 days to be the same distance, it needs to be 3x and not 4x, so the new equation is 3x ~ 4 + x▲ = 30The solution is x = 6 that means two days before the race they ran 20 miles and one day they ran 12 miles. The new equation is (6 + 6)/3 = x x = 18 meanwn that the final 3 days they ran 18 miles.The answer is 10.question:#

The average of Jesse's first day is 1.75 milesx3 = 5.50 milesThe average for her second day is 2/3 that of the first = 3.5 milesThe average for her third day is 3.5(3)=10.25 milesThe final average is 25.50 milesSo the average of her average of the final three days is (25.50+25.50+25.50)/3 days = 25.0000 miles.Question Part 2 You can skip this part if your teacher does not give it to you.The average of Mia's first day is 3 milesThe average of her second day is (2/3 of 4 days) * (1/3 of 4 days) = 5/4 milesThe average of her third day is 5.5(1/3 of 4 days) = 2.25 milesThe final average is (25/2)+(25/2)+(25/2)= 25 miles5/5*25= 25*25*25*25*25*5 = 3125/25= 100 miles  The average of their averages is 25 miles or#

Thus the average of Mia and Jesse's avg. is 3 x 40 = 120 miles per week." So, the avg of 2000 is 30 ÷ 7 = 4.Thus, Mia and Jesse must average 3 miles per day for 3 x 4 = 12 more days. By the end of their race they will have completed 30 miles the first three days + 12 x 3 = 36 miles = 108 miles.Therefore, their average is 420/7 = 30 miles/week." Thus, "The answer is 30 miles per week."The answer is 30 miles per week.question:#
