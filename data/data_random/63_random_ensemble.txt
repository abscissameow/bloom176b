The minimum she can do must be 30 situps and also more than 19 situps to use all of her situp attempts so we will solve for the variables x and y where $x + y = 27$Since she made up for the ones she didn't do on Monday, she will have to do 30 more than 19 which means $x = 29$ and $y = 31$The minimum that she can do is $20 + 30 = 50$, so we have that $12<20$ and $30>19$ and $32/64 < 20 < 48/64$Therefore, $50 < 48/64 <49/64$ and $50 < 49/64$ so $50$ is the SOLUTION.The answer is 50.

Tuesday = 12 + 19 = 31Shawna's goal was 30 so she did 31 - 30 = 1 more on WednesdayTotal: 31 + 1 = 32The answer is 32.2. Answer#

She was able to do 14 on Tuesday so she will need 19-12 = 7 on WednesdayThe goal is 30 every day so 7 x 2 = 14To complete the 30 situps, she will need to do 14 more situps, so the answer is 14 question:"My Fair Princess" is a remake of "The Little Mermaid" but the prince is lead man instead of the main character.

Solve for x ′. This is the number of situps needed on Wednesdays. It can be found by subtracting 12 + 19 from her goal 30. Or rather 30 - 12 + 19.12 + 9 = 21Therefore, x ′ = 21 − 29 21 − 12 x ′ = 19 − 19 x ′ = 30 30Solving for x ′ yields x ′ = 11 − 20 11 − 19 x ′ = 11 − 30 x ′ = 20 30The answer is 20.

She must perform an integer number of situps, so let us split the 30 situps into 3 equal parts, like in a pie chart.In order to make up for the 12 situps she missed on Monday, she must do 2 parts on Monday.The number of situps she does on Monday is 12 * 2 = 24.Therefore, she must do 24 - 12 = 12 more situps than the goal on Tuesday.She is not close enough yet, so she continues to work up to the goal. The goal is 30 situps, but we split 30 situps into 3 parts. She must do 2 parts, like we did with Monday.She does 6 more situps on Tuesday to make up for what she didn't the day before.Therefore, she performed 12 + 6 = 18 more situps on Tuesday than her goal.Total situps = 12 + 6 + 30 = 46 ′ 30 ′′She had three days.The answer is 60.question:#

12 situps + 19 situps = 31 situpsOn Monday, she was doint 12 sit ups and on Tuesasy, she was doint 19. The number of situps on Wednesday will be: 12(3) taken away by 20 situps, which equals 8 situps.The number of situps that Shawna had to do on Wednesday was 8*6=48Wednesday is: 48 - 31 situps = 17 situpsThe answer is 17.question:#

As we understand, Shawna set the goal of doing at least 30 situps in one spot.  Thus, she would need to meet the following condition:# of situps on Wednesday >= her number of situps minus the difference between what she did and her #of situps = 12 - (30-12) = 12 - 18 = 6>= 1 | | 1 + 6 = 7The answer is 7.question:#

On Monday, she did 12 situps. There are 3 more situps to meet her goal. Thus, she should do 12 + 3 = 15 situps on Monday.On Tuesday, she did 19 situps. Thus, there are 11 more situps she must do.Thus, she must do 19 + 11 = 30 situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal of 30 situps.The answer is 30.question:#
