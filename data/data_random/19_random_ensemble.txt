Tim rides each 20-mile trip in a time of 20 รท 25 =  0.8 hours.Does that mean the trip takes 20 รท 25 = 0.8 hours?20 x 0.75 = 15 minutes for a round trip.So, he can bike from his house to work 20 miles away or back in a total of 15 + 15 = 30 minutes for each day.The 5 days for working days are 5 x 30 = 150 minutes biking each week.If he does the same time for the weekend too, he biked a total of 150 + 180 = 300 minutes a week.Since he is into biking for a total of 300 minutes a week, that is 2 x 150 minutes per week.The answer is 360 minutes week.Explore the dynamic world of numbers#

Workday 1 =20 miles/2 = 10 milesWorkday 2 = 20 miles/2= 10 milesWorkday 3 = 20 miles/2 = 10 milesWorkday 4  = 10 milesWorkday 5  = 10 milesDrago ride: For each of the 5 workdays,  Tim rides 10 miles indoor, plus he goes for a weekend bike ride of 200miles that  takes 30 minutes for a return journey (100 miles)to work, leaving 50  minutes for cycling back and forth work totaling upto 150 miles2 * 25 millas 25 miles = 250miles = 250 miles =3 hoursThe answer is 3.question:#

He can do 1 round trip to work + 4 round trips to weekends = 5 weekdays.This is 5 * 20 miles = 100 mile per weekday.Iran do this in 100 miles / 25 mph = 40 minutes per round trip.His round trips are 5 times that amount.He biked 100 miles / 40 minutes = 2.5 miles per minute.This means 200 miles in 2 * 2.5 miles = 5 hours of biking.So, he biked 200 in 5 * 5 = 25 minutes.The answer is 25 minutes.question:#

Weekdays: 20 miles * 5 days/week * 50 minutes/mile = 5000 minutes5000 minutes / 7 days/week * 8 hours/day = 1250 minutes = 12 hours / week2 working days: 38 miles*50 minutes/mile = 180220 minutes*30 minutes/hour = 648 minutes648 minutes / 7 days/week = 101.428 hoursWorking days: 40 miles*50 minutes/mile = 2000 minutes2000 minutes / 7 days * 8 hours/day = 504 minutes504 minutes / 7 days = 72 hoursThe answer is 72 hours.question:#

For one day he cycles (working + weekend) 4 times. This is (20 + 200)/4 = 80 miles.His travel time rate is 80/25 = 3 hours.His travel time for five workdays is (80*5)/25 = 20 hoursHis travel time is 20 + 20 = 40 hours.The answer is 40.question:#

20 miles / 50 miles /5 days work = 2 miles per work day5 * 7 days + (200 miles / 50 miles /5 days) = (1 mile * 5 workdays) + (200 miles / 7 days) = 655 miles/weekTo do these 655 miles, he bikes per week, ((655 miles * 50 miles) / 5 days) * (25 mph) = (25 * 655 miles) / 5 days = 2025 miles/weekSo it takes 2025 miles per week which is 2025 / 50 miles/day = 44 minutes per day.The answer is 44 minutes.#

Going back and forth to work for each of the 5 workdays looks like this:(25 mph * 12 miles TO work) + (25 mph * 8 miles FROM work)DO the math - 200 milesLet's pretend it takes him 5 days (or 50 hours) to bike the 200 miles intentionally for the weekend.He spends 25 mph * 200 miles=50 hours of timeBiken all this - (25 mph * 12 miles TO work) + (25 mph * 8 miles FROM work) = 20 miles adding the 20 miles per workday, that means it takes 50-20=30 hours of time to bike it going the whole time at 25 mphHe needs 50 - 30 = 20 hours to bike the 200 miles.200/20 = 20 time..So it would take 20 hours..The answer is 20.question:#

Each work day is 20 miles long.So he rides 20 miles four times every week.It takes him 20 miles to go to work and 20 miles to come back.Over the course of a week his bike ride is 50 miles.Each four weeks of biking a week make a month.His bike ride a month is 25 * 4 = 1000 miles.His bike ride a month was 1000 / 20 = 50 mile, so his bike ride a week is 50/20 = 2.5 miles.If it takes him 2 minutes to bike 1 mile, that means it took him 25 hours to bike 200 miles.His bike ride a week is 2.5 * 5 = 12.5 hours.The answer is $2.5 x 5 = 12.5 hours.The answer is 12.5#

5 ways of biking to work per week is: 5x20 = 100 miles.5 ways of biking for a weekend ride totaling 200 miles is: 5x200 = 1000 miles.The following is a problem with a car and its fuel efficiency. 60 mpg at 45 mphThe answer is 1000 miles / 45 minutes = 22.22 hours.The total distance he travels is 100 miles for#

Each day, Tim goes to work that is 20 miles away.The next workday, the distance is 20+20+20=60 miles.The next workday, the distance is 60+60+60=180 miles.Finally, the next workday, the distance is 180+180+180=360 milesThe 190 miles travelled for each workday are 2*190=390 milesSo Tim rides 390*5=1590 miles for the weekThe answer is 1590.question:#
