double: 2 * 1750 = 3 * 1750 - Kens part:  3 * 1750 / 2 * 1750 = 1750 - 1920/750 = 24 What is Kens share of all the money? ** Since Barb shared all the money, that Kens share would be 24/750.The answer is 1225.question:#

Set up and simplify the equation:Kens share is Said that Tony got twice as much as Ken, which means the share he got was 2Kens share. Substitute this inside the equation to cancel out the Ken portion:Bes share = 2Kens share + Portion Tony received. ThereforeSharesum = 2Kens share + Sharesum.Want to proceed further or use the result help? ** Simplify the expression toSharesum = 2Kens share + Sharesum.Determine the value of ** To divide by KenSam obtained two parts, so ** Note that K is more than T, soSam wants more of the money for his son Ken than for Tony, so Sam wanted toShare more with Ken than with Tony, so 2 > 1.Post more if you want to use the answer with help and already solved!The answer is 1450.#

If Ken got $1750, then 17500 = (K + N) and 17500 / N is K where K is Ken and N is the money shared.If Ken got $1750, then 17500 / N = K where K is Ken and N is the money shared.17500 = (K + N)17500 / N = K where K is Ken and N is the money shared.17500 / N = K where K is Ken and N is the money shared17500 / K = N where K is Ken and N is the money shared17500 / 1750 = N (52 weeks in year)17500 / 1750 = N (52 weeks in year)175 = NHow many months has Ken? ** Above equation becomes 175 = NHow many months has Ken? ** Therefore, Ken got $50,625 per month for him and his brother.The money shared was $150,000The answer is $150,000.LINK TO MORE QUEST#

This is a variation of a question already done. It is the same number given, but a different division of the total.How much money did Mr. Sam share? ** Let M be the amount that Mr. Sam shared money.The amount that both sons received that day was D = q * M ** where how much did each son get = q.Divided by 2 ** Thus, how much did each son get, where his brother gets 2x the the amount he got is q = 50/100 or 0.5.Therefore, the total amount is Q = 50/100 * MThe answer is M.question:#

The boys got $1750. So Ken got $1750 / 2 = $875 and Tony got twice as much so it must be $875 + $875 = $1750.

So Tony got twice as much as Ken, so he received $5000.Therefore $5000 is twice as much as $1750. So $1750 - $5000 = $-1250. Thus Tony received $5000.Tony received $5000 + $5000 - $5000 = $5000 The answer to the question is $5000.question:#

Determine whether the answer is whole number / half / quarter / third / etc.  If not then decimal#

The number of dollars shared is **** Let mx be the amount shared. Ken was going to get amount x and Tony was going to get amount 2 * x.Then x + 2 * x = 2600m **  And the equation can be written as 1500 = x + 2 * x = 2600m.Now equate the x's **  So now we can solve for x + x = 2600mNow divide by 2 **  Thus we can now solve for x = 1500 / 2 = 750m.Thus,math worked out that x + x = 2600m and also it was divided by 2, so math would have worked out the x as the the answer.question#

What is the amount of money shared?  ** K was $1750.How much did Ken get? ** K= $1750.What is Tonys share? ** Thus Tony inherited $2050.What is the amount of money shared?  ** Therefore, the amount of money shared is $2050.The answer is $2050.question:#

Enable a variable ** Define a variable ** Let m be the amount that Mr. Sam shared between his two sons.Define another variable ** Let x be the amount Ken receives.Define another variable ** Let y be the amount Tony gets.Write an equation ** The sum = x + y = m.Express in more general terms ** Solve for the variable m.Question ** x + 2y = mDivide by 2 ** y + x = 2 mDividing both sides by 2 ** x = 2m/3Substitute variable and solve for x ** m = x + y = 3m/2 = x + 3m/2 = 2mScrew arithmetic progression ** Let m = 1000.Substitute m = 1000. ** Thus, the amount that Mr. Sam shared between his two sons was x = 250, and y = 500.The answer is 250.question:#
