Define a variable x as jack earns.Find x

         Define a variable y as how much money jack earns. 
            y = amount Jack earns.while y < amount Lisa earns.So y = half1x = amount Lisa earns.while y < 2y
            halfs = HALF(y)
            med = half(s)
            so y = half(y) + halfs.
        establish expression
         x = half(s) + half1(half(s)).
        Add halfs from the last line and fix the problem.
         x = half(s) + half1(s) + 2(half(s)).Simplify the equation
         x = 3(half(s) + s) + s + halfs - s.       Remove first half from the last line
         x = s + s + 2s - halfs + halfs.
         The first line could not be on the last because it wont be a whole number if there is anything inside the#

For part (a): Think about what happens if you take the decimal that represents the dollar amounts with the decimal point and move it to the lefthand side (like when factoring trinomials). The answer will be 60 divided by 20 (since the total is $60). For part (#

How much money did Tommy earn? ** Jack metioned he earned $60 and Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, $60 / 2 = $30.How much more did Lisa earn than Tommy? ** She earned however more than Tommy because 30 = $60 / 2 + $30.How much money did Tommy earn? ** Therefore, Tommy earned $60 / 2 = $30 and was earning half the money of Lisa.The answer is $30 more.question:#

Before solving this problem, do some of the problems that are close to it and make sure you understand the techniques being usedNow let * R be the number of dollars that Lisa earnedQuestion ** Let t be the number of dollars that Tommy earned.Therefore, 60 = R + T and L = 60/2 = 30.L owns 1/2 L ** The amount of L owned by Lisa is 30/2 = 15.Call L = L/2 ** Label L/2 as ** Then 30 = L -t and 15 = L - t - L = 2t + LDividing by 2 ** Solving, 2t + 10 = L ** 2 divided by 2 is 1 which simplifies to 2t + 10/2 = Lsolving, 10/2 is 5 and L is 20 The next formula will solve this problem 5D(L) = TQuestion ** If 10 = 1 + T, then T = 9 * (L)Answer ** therefore; 5 * L = T = 5 * 20 = 9 * 5 = 45 and 5(15) = 9 * 45 = 4.5The answer#
