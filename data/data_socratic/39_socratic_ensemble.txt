How many more pieces does Anna get? ** (60*14 - 75*11) / 14 = 30.More pieces does Anna get? ** 30/14= 2 houses.More does Anna get? ** Ok, a house at Anna's subdivision will have 2x - 1 = 17 rooms.Substitute again ** 2x x 14 = 17 * 11.Combined into one equation ** 2x - 1 = x * (60 - 75)So how many more does Anna get? ** 2x - 1 = (x * 60 + 75) / 2. This inequality simplifies to x = 20 times and this is the wrong answer.The answer is 20.question:#

How many more pieces of candy does Anna get than Billy gets? ** Let X be the number more pieces of candy that Anna gets than Billy gets.Then, 14 of Billy 60 = Anna X of 75.Write an equation ** Therefore, 14 * 60 + X * 75 = 11 * 60.Simplify ** The second side can be simplified by combining terms.11 * 60 - 14 * 60 - X * 75 ** When combined, we can acquire 11 * 75 = 11 * 25 + X * 25.Add the original equation for 11 * 25 + X * 25 bottom ** Now that there are terms that cancel with 1375, this equation simplifies to X=75 - X = 60.The answer is 60.#

 Billy gets +11 x 60 = 660 applesSo, Anne has added 15 penitions to her sister +660 -11, if she got 660 more than her brother she had no answers.The question#

In the problem though, it says Anna and Billy went to two different subdivisions so the first subdivision would be the 30 houses and therefore the second subdivision would be the remaining 55 houses.How many more pieces of candy does Anna get? ** Remember she gets 14 pieces of candy per house so if you had X total houses she gets 14*X total pieces of candy.Do both subdivisions add up to the total number of houses ** 55 + 30 = 85 since 96 would be an awkward answer.The problem requires the number of more pieces of candy that Anna gets.#

If Billy got more pieces than Anna why does making him do an extra subdivision make him fewer pieces of reglan candy? ** Because the first thing the teachers notices is that the results are subtracts (11 - 14 = -3) but it is not saying this - so it is not true these numbers subtract to 3.So the correct answer to this is 23 pieces.question:#

How many more pieces of candy does Anna get? ** The number of houses of the second subdivision is 13 * 75 = 965 more.How many more pieces of candy does Anna get? ** Then Anna gets 8 + 965 = 986 more pieces of candy.How many more pieces of candy does Anna get? ** Thus, the answer is 986.Out of 200 (#

As the first subdivision has 60 houses, the total number of treats will be 14 * 60 = 840 pieces.The total number of treats will be 640 * 60 = 352, 000 pieces of candy.Combining both results shows 352, 000 / 14 = 22, 856.As the second subdivision has 75 houses, the total number of treats will be 11 * 75 = 825 pieces.The total number of treats will be 640 * 75 = 404, 000 pieces of candy.Combining both results shows 404, 000 / 11 = 36, 000.The number of treats that Anna gets = 602, 746.As her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking in the neighboring subdivision of 75 houses, the total number of treats she gets = 9, 720.The total number of treats = 920 * 75 = 725, 825.As he gets 11 treats per house in subdiv#

The first subdivision has 60 houses and Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house.  So Anna gets 14*60 = 840b. The second subdivision has 75 houses and Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house.  So Billy gets 11*75 = 875c. Anna will get 14*8 + 11*975 = 14*60 + 11*75 + 13*15 = 14*60 + 13*75 + 11*75 + 11*105 + 11*15 = 7*60 + 8*75 + 1165Lastly, Anna has 14*60 + 1165 = 1160 pieces of candyThis project contains contributions from Alex Randall, Marco athapopoulos, anndarren, Carson Stachura, samantha hollingshead, Anthony Borelli, Emily Queen, Misa Papuglielmo, HMaerney, Madison Farrell, Ethan Bloom, Alyssa Hest, Buel Brooker, authorOk, so her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking, he gets 11 pieces per house.So the first subdivision has 60 houses and#

How many more pieces of candy does Anna get? ** And the number of extra houses in the first subdivision is 60 x 14 - 75 x 11 = 175 - 105 = 70.So 17 + 7 = 24 houses with extra candy.The answer is 24 extra pieces of candy.#

Divide the candy(s) *** Due to dividing the candy by the houses, the two sections of the subdivision could become approximate. Define a variable ** Let x be the pieces of candy Anna gets.Define x/80 as house1 * house1/80 = x * x/14 = x * If the subdivisions become approximate then 9.2 * 60 = x and 5.6 * 75 = x. Then the mathematical operation to get the correct result is a division by distributing the division so if 60 x = 9.2x then 9.2 x = 60 x then 9x2=60 thats a division by 2 and if x then 15 x = 5.6x then 5.6 x = 15 x then 5.6x2=21.2x is a good combination of constants.How many more pieces of candy does Anna get? ** And Anna gets 16 pieces of candyÂ¾ of the way there from 15 so she gets 16 - 15 /3#
