About 40% more books than the daily average would be  40+40*(1/0.4) = 80 books.How many days from Monday to Friday is the library open? ** And the answer is 7 days.So how many books does he borrow in a week if the library is open#

How many books does Krystian borrows in a week? ** Write an equation. The number of books Krystian borrows in the week is equal to his daily average x 5 days.The number of books Krystian borrows in a week. ** Debugging the expression yields 240 = 5 (daily average x 5 days).Solve the equation ** Divide by the daily average.....237/5 = 44.73.Students, please share your sample Answers for the Class 9th - Maths Unit 7 problem questions and solutions.Use the Down-arrow key or 'page down'#

Divide by 7 to find daily average: 40/7 = 6Books every day. ** Multiply by 7 to find total borrowed in seven days: 6 x 7 = 42Discount 25% on Friday. ** Subtract six every Friday 42 25% = 42 - 7 = 35Books in a week. ** The library is open from Monday to Friday.Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than a daily average. ** Let the number of books borrowed every Friday be F. Multiply by 7 to get total books borrowed on Fridays for seven days: F 7/7 = 7.Subtract 42 total borrowed: 7 - 42 = -2After Fridays, add books borrowed every other day: 4* 7 =35books in a week. ** The total books borrowed in a week of work is 35.The answer is 35.question:#

Let X be the number of books that Krystian takes out on Fridays. Then 40 + (X - 40) - (X - 40)/4 = X - 40. This means, X/10 = X/40 + X/4So, this means X = (40 + 10)/4. Since X is an integer it must be  X = (40 + 10)/4 = 6. The library is open from Monday to Saturday. Lets add 16 days. Thus, in a week, Krystian will take out 6 * 16 = 96 books.The answer is 96.question:#

Define variables ** Let A be the number of days in a week.Let B be the number of books that Krystian borrows on a given day.After all is said and done To solve this equation, we need to evaluate A/5. * B + B - X.Therefore, if we take B/15 as X, the answer is 40 – ((1*3*5) * B) + ((2*3*4) * B) – ((3*0*2) * B) + ((3*1*3) * B) = 40 – (2 * 3) * B + (3 * 4) * B – (4) * B + 5 * B = 7 * B – 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 32 – 2 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 40 – 2 + 13 + 5 = 55 booksThe answer is 55 books.question:#

Let x and y be defining variables x is the number of books that Krystian borrows on the daily averagey is the number of books that Krystian borrows on Fridays we know x is the same as 40, and we know y is 40 * 1.4 = 56 we know y is one average of 40 plus a times x add 80 books now we know x plus y y is the average of 40 plus a times x add 80 is 115 so we can add x and help us found x plus y and now we have the equation x plus y is 115 40 plus a x equals 115 now we can use parenthesis to get rid of the x and we get a x plus y plus five is equal to 115 and now we have a x plus five x is three x the x plus five three x plus five is seventy well x equals to 40 and y is 40 plus a times x is 40 plus 20 solutions or matchings to the equation are 80, 90,#

Add 3 days to each set ** Let x be the number of books that Krystian borrowed in each day. Write an equation and solve for x  = 40*x + 3/7(x + 3) Combine like terms X (40 + 3/7)(x + 3) / 7  Divide both sides by 7  = 22/7. Simplify to the nearest whole number ** (Don’t forget negative numbers!) Always use a calculator here **  = 23.5.round to the nearest whole number **  = 24.The mdoel answer is 24 books, but it goes either way.The answer is 24.#

Define a variable ** Let C be the number of books Krystian borrowed between Monday and Friday.How many books does he borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday? ** So the number of books he borrowed from Monday to Friday in a week is C * 5.Write an equation ** And the number of books he borrowed in a week is 105 = C * 5 - 5 / 7 * C.Simplify ** And dividing both sides by 7 produces C = 25.The answer is 25.question:#

The daily average is 40 books each day.The daily average is 40 books each day. ** Let D be the daily average.The daily average is 40 books each day. ** For example, Monday would be 40 x 5 = 200 books.How many books does Krystian borrow in a week if he borrow five days each week? ** Therefore the number of books that Krystian borrowed within a week is 40 each day x 5 days each week = 200 books.The answer is 200.#

Define a new variable ** let O be the number of books Krystian borrows each day.How many books does Krystian borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday? ** Then the number of books Krystian borrows in a week would be 4*O.Write an equation ** The number of books Krystian borrows from Monday to Friday would be 40*O.Simplify ** 40*O = 4O.Divide by 1 ** O = 25.How many books does Krystian borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday? ** The variable Or number of books Krystian borrows in a week would be 25.The answer is 25.question:#
