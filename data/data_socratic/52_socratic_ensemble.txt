How many pencils are in each box? ** Write a variable with the number pencils in each box. In each box holds 3 pencilsTherefore, the number of pencils are three times the # of boxes ** Thus, the variable would be 3 * the # of boxes.Determine the # of boxes ** The number of pencils are 3 * the # of boxes, according to the pounds of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.  In each box holds 3 pencilsTherefore 5 x 3 = 15 × 3 = 45 thus the number of boxes = 3x45 = 90 pencilsArnel had 10 boxes (90 pencils)The number of pencils in each box = 90/10 = 9 pencilsIn each box holds 3 pencilsTherefore 3 x 9 = 27 pencilsIn each box holds 3 pencilsTherefore 5 * 3 = 15 pencilsIn each box holds 3 pencilsTherefore 5 x 3 = 15 × 3 = 45 thus the number of#

How many pencils are in each box? ** Let x be the number of pencils in each box1. Arnel kept ten pencils. There are 10 * x = 90 pencils.2. If he shared equally with five friends, his friends would each get 24 pencils (or x * 5 + 10 - x = 90).3. The result is x * 1 + x - 8 = 30.The answer is 30 pencils in each box.question:#

What total number of pencils was given Arnel?  To find this, first, we have to figure out how many pencils were extracted from each box. We know that each box contained ten pencils.  Arnel kept ten of the pencils and gave away five from each of the ten boxes.  So, the number of pencils extracted from each box = 10 + 5 * x = 10 + 25 = 35Pencils was extracted by Arnel from each box? ** So there were ten times 35 = 350 pencils total.How many boxes of pencils contained five pencils each? ** There were 350 pencils, so that meant there were 350/5 = 70 pencils in each box.The answer is 350/5 = 70 pencils in each box.The answer is 70.#

There are four ways to solve this problem: ** Strategy 1: Add the number of pencils with the same units gives us 10+10+10+10+10 = 50 pencils.Divide by 5 friends ** Therefore, the number of pencils was 10 * 5 = 50 per person.Strategy 2: Add the number of pencils with the same units gives us 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 pencils.Put the number of friends = 5 in the equation ** Divide 50 by 5 friends gives a result of 10 * 5 =50 لكل شخص.So the number of pencils per person is 10 resulting in a total of 50 pencils in each box. 選擇：A man has a crop of fruits.
