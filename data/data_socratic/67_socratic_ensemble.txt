So on the first 3 days their average was (2/3) * 30 = 20 miles?How many average miles did Mia run on IE on the day? ** Then on the first 4 days their average was (1/3) * 30 = 15 miles.What is the average of their average? ** And over the final 3 days they have to average 15 more miles.For example, if they run 16 miles over the final 3 days then 1/15 + 16/15 + 3 + 3 = 2/3.Their average will run 26 miles? ** So their average is 26 miles over these first 5 days.The answer is 26.question:#

First, let see the halves of the value of Jesse's average. ** So over the first three days Jesse averaged (2/3)** We need to convert the fractions into a fraction with the same denominator. ** So 13/3 = 3/5.Question: What is their average on days 1-5? ** And then they averaged 3 miles per day on the first four days.Question: What is the answer to the question? ** And then over the final three days the two of them averaged 4/3 miles.#

The average is 30 miles that they must run in 7 days or (30/7) miles a day. The average  is 30/7 = 4.2857... miles a day.  The simple average   of the average   is (4.2857... * 4.2857... * 4.2857...) = 12.5714... miles a day  over the next three days. The final two days is (4.5714... * 4.5714...) = 15.7142 miles a day.The answer is 12.5714... + 4.5714...#

Do you see anything strange about this example? ** In general, it is important to use the same day to get the total mileage covered.Jesse and Mia are competing in a week long race. ** This is a five day assignement.They have one week to run 30 miles. ** To land on the correct side of the = sign, you must have 20 miles.  So therefore, there use to 5 days where they have to run 5 days * 5 days = 30 miles in all.On The first three days Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile On day four she runs 10 miles. Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days. These numbers are for the first 4 days. For example: For the first 4 days Jesse averages 30/3 = 10 miles.  For the first 4 days Mia averages 30/4 = 7.5 miles.What is the#

First average of the 5 averages they have to run over the final 3 days?scale ** Let A be the number of miles running per day.Unpacking ** Then 30 - A + A * 10 = 30 * (1 - (2/3)) * 4.One average of the 5 averages they have to run over the final 3 days?scale ** Let B be the average of 10 and 4*A.Unpacking ** That is B = 10 + A * 4.One average of the 5 averages they have to run over the final 3 days? scale ** Let C be the average of 30 and 8*A over the final day.Therefore  the solution is ((1 - 2/3) * 4) + (10 + A * 4) + 30 * (1 - 2/3) = 31.9 * AAfter unpicking the answers can minimise by 1/2, minus 5, multiply by 6 / 8 - 1 / 2 + 1/3, and add 1.#

How much distance did Jesse and Mia run on their first 4 days? ** So the total amount of distance they have to run of day 2 - day 5 would be 4 * 3 miles.Write an equation ** Then the total they have to run on day 2 - day 5 is (3 x 2)(3) = 80 miles.Simplify ** Combine like terms (3*3) = 9.Divide by 3 ** 60 is half of 80 so 80/3 = 25.Put the right number on the left side ** So 2(25) = 30.difference and sum (add and subtract are same) ** So the difference between the average of day 6 -day 7 would be 2(3).The average of their average that they have to run over the final three days would be 2 (3).halfway to the race ** The answer is 2 (3) = 6 miles.The correct answer is 6.question:#

Let ** x be Jesse's average miles that Jesse had to run for the final 3 days.Let ** y be Mia's average miles that Mia had to run for the final 3 days.Mia runs 10 miles on day four. ** So on day four Mia ran (3x - 10) miles with an average of 3.Jesse runs 30/2 miles on the first three days. ** So on day three Jesse ran (2x - 30/2) miles with an average of 3.Mia and Jesse's average miles that they have to run over the final three days is the average of the average.2Ted must average 3 of a mile per day to run 30 miles over the final 3 days. Thus, 3x/30 = 30.3x - 30 = 0 ** a = 3xSolution for a ** The answer is 3x = 30 as the answer is 3 miles a day.** total mileage for#

How many miles does Mia average over the final three days?  ** Mia averages 30 miles over the final three days.How many miles did Mia average over the first 4 days?  ** So from the first 4 days Mia averaged 60/3 miles per day.From the first 4 days Mia averaged 60/3 miles per day.  ** Over three days Mia will average 60/3 * 3 = 75 miles on those days.What is the average of their average that they run over the final three days? ** So what is the new average that Mia and Jesse have to run over the final 3 days?Think of it as Mia averaging the average of the average Mia and Jesse have to run over the final 3 days. Since the final 3 days runs gives 60/3 runs per day, Mia averages those 60/3 runs 75 times. Therefore Mia's average is 75 * 60/3 = 375 runs per day on those#

On the first three days Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile. On day four she runs 10 miles. Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days. What is the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days? Because the first three days they both averaged the same amount, we can look at the first 4 days the between the average days. Thus they have 1/3 + 2/3 + 10 + 3 = 10/3 days. Thus the average of all the days up to that point is 10/3 miles average = 5/3 miles. )days over the final three days? ** The average of all the days is 5/3 miles.The average of all the days is 5/3 miles.answer: Harry and Ben ordered lunch. They both ordered a ham and#

-(2/3) 30 = 6/3 On the first three days Jesse averages 30 miles Jesse has 30 - 10 = 20 miles to run on the final three days average Zoe has a running average of 20/3 + 10 + 10 + 10/3 miles = 100/3 miles the average of their running average is 100/3+5/3+4/54+6/24100/3 + 5/3 + 44/6 = 8/188/18= 7 lazes*the answer was wrong; so the answer was so helpfull************************* *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** *************** ***************problem-choose day 1 to 5 how many and day five#
