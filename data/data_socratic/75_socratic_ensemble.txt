Let T be the number of slices of toast, and E be the number of eggs.T + E = 2;  Dale had 2 slices of toast and 2 eggs.T + E = 1;  Andrew had 1 slice of toast and 2 eggs.Divide each equation by the same value 1  Dales breakfast cost Seven-Hundred and Fifty Pence.  (7 x £1 + 5 x £3) ÷ T + E = 2;  Dale had 2 slices of toast and 2 eggs.T + E = 1;  Andrew had 1 slice of toast and 2 eggs.Invert the latter equation and multiply by T + E  £(1 / (1 / T)) E + £(1 / (1 / T)) ((T + E) * (T - E))  £(1 / (1 / 2)) E + £(1 / (1 / 2))((2 + 2)) =  £(1 / (1 / 2))E = Ten Pence * E = Ten Pence * E = 10pSevenandFiftyPenceSevenandFiftyPenceSevenandFiftyPenceSevenandFiftyPenceSevenandFiftyPenceSevenandFifty PenceSevenandFifty PenceSevenandFifty PenceSevenandFifty PenceSevenand#
