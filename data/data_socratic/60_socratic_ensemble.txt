Don't drink a lot of water after coming home from a concentrated workout. Keep it in mind, everyone is human, if you are more than 7, drink water but if you are less than 7,#

Define a variable ** Let H be the number of hours that Jerry spends at the field watching his daughters.  Hangs with the girls ** Consequently, H (watching the girls) will include watching games at the field plus 4 or 6 hours for practice (the total practice for a team is 4 hours).Work out the total hours ** Add the total games and the 4 hours of practice for each team.Recount the hours ** The total number of hours is: 7 x 4 = 28 games plus (4 + 6) team-practice hours (in 28-game season).Hangs with the girls ** Plus 29 (watching the games and practice time for team A) hr.Works out the total ** Tracing back to H, we get 7 H. (Recounting the individual times with each team and adding them all up will bring you back to H.)Picture a girl club **#

** Let T be the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field.Jerrys daughters play 2 games each so they will play 4 teams.Let A be the number of teams each daughter plays for.Therefore, Jerry will spend 4*2*A = 8 hours at the field.question: There are 75 children in a school.

Jerry spends 8*4:4 = 32 hours watching his daughters play and practice altogether.question: Carla was practicing to play in her school talent show. She arrived at her dance lesson 20 minutes late and lost 5 minutes talking to her friends. She then had another 5 minute practice break for lunch. At the end of the lesson she was 10 minutes behind the original time table. How long did Carla spend practicing?answer: How much time did Carla spend practicing? ** Carla spent less than an hour practicing thus the formula used is 5*n, where n represents the subtractivepart.Write an equation ** And x is less than 5 minutes less than an hour thus x#

Note that since Jerry is watching his daughters ** Event A: Jerry is watching his Daughters ** Divide the total by 2 because he has two daughters.Set up equation ** So Jerry is watching for 4/2 hours.How many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether? ** Therefore, Jerry is watching his daughters for 4*7 hours = 28 hoursSo, the answer is 28 hours.question:#

• Each game lasts for 2 hours so 8/2 = 4 games per team; • Each team practices 4 hours so 12 games x 4 = 48 hours practicing; • 48 hours practicing + 4 hours for every game played by Carla + 4 hours for every game played by Jessica = 2 + 4 + 4 = 8 hours.All together, Jerry will spend 8 hours watching his daughters.The answer is 8.
1. mebrury 13th. (c)2. Answer to exercise 14.35#

let A be the number of hours Jerry spends at the field watching his daughters play and practice.Then Jerry will spend 8 * x hours at the field.What else can we know? ** Jerry spends 4 hours playing each game. What else can we know?** What if a team practices 4 hours for every game they play? How many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether? ** Even if a team practices 4 hours for every game they play for 8 games, there will still be more hours spent at the field watching a game.If one team practices 4 hours per game per 15 games** Then for 1 team to play 8 games for 4 hours per game was 32 hours.** Then to play 1 game for 4 hours per game was 4 hours.#

Like in the previous problem, we are required to add the number of games they have. For bala, she has 14 and jerry's older daughter has 16. Simplify the sentence before you start the calculation: 14+16= do I have to convert the unit? ** Of course.14 + 16 = 28 and this is just a number — you don't have to change it into any other unit as far as I know. Simply write it out in full. Write 28. The key question is how many hours. 28 hours might go across the whole year or at least school year.You might have noticed already how simplifying can help in this problem. 16 + 26 = 44 +52 and 52 can easily be reconverted to hours by dividing/dividing by 24. then NYtimes would be recommended ** It won't. Although 6.6 is close to 7 which is the answer grade of#
