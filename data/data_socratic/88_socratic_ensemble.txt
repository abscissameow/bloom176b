The year before is better defined as the year before that, because the time period before the second year is irrelevant.Thus, twice that many geckos is 86 in the second year.-- but 86 is not twice 86 -- its only double the number 44.Therefore, the year before, Brandon sold 44 geckos.

Then add twice the number of geckos sold last year.These facts will be used to get the finished answer.Brandon sold two more geckos this year 86#

Write a variable ** Let x be the number of geckos that Brandon sold.How many geckos has Brandon sold in the last two years? ** The total is 2x = 2 * 86 geckos.Write an equation ** Thus the sum of the last two years is 2x + 2 * 8x = 176 geckos.Make equation true by a factor on both sides of the equation ** Solve x = 176 /8 or there is another way:176 / 8 * x = 176 /8So, x = 128 รท 4 or 8.So, x = 128 or 128 + 8 = 136 Now, we multiplied x to get what we wanted. Remember x * 2134.  The answer is 136 geckos.question:#

Brandon sold 86 geckos last year. He sold twice that many the year before. ** Let f represent number of geckos that Brandon sold last year. Let 2x represent number of geckos that Brandon sold the year before. Brandon sold 86 geckos last year. ** Since 86 - f - 86 = 0Simplify ** f = 0, thus the f = 26.How many geckos has Brandon sold in the last two years? ** Since 2x represents the number of geckos that Brandon sold the year before. When it is combined with itself. 2x = 2x, which simplifies to x = 1.Then, Brandon sold 1 gecko more last year than the year prior. The number of geckos that Brandon sold in the last two years can be determined by adding 86 + 26 = 1 session.The answer is 1.#

In order for the year to be two years ago, the year before that should be one year ago.Therefore, calculate the number of geckos Brandon sold one year ago./206 x 12 = 36848.Therefore, calculate the number of geckos Brandon sold two years ago./206 x 12 = 36840.Therefore, then the number of geckos that Brandon has sold in the last two years is 86 + 36848 = 36840.The answer is 36840.#

Define a variable ** Let a be how many geckos Brandon sold.How many geckos did Brandon sell the year before? ** Since the value of x, the number of geckos Brandon sold last year is 2 * 57, therefore the number of every geckos Brandon sold the year before is 2x. How much did Brandon vender last year.So 2x = 86, and the number of geckos Brandon sold last year is 2 * a = 2 * 57 = 114.How many geckos has Brandon sold in two years? ** Define two variables: ** Let b be the number of geckos Brandon sold last year, and let c be the number of geckos Brandon sold this year.How many geckos did Brandon sell in two years? ** Combining b and c produces x = b + c.How many geckos did Brandon vender this year? ** Did Brandon vender 86 geckos last year, then he would vender 2 *#
