At this step, the calculation is 27 + (7) - (7), so it is 27 + 0 = 27 kg. Then 13 + (7) - (7) is 13 + 3 = 16kg.question: Jason bought 10 apples for 90 cents each. If he wants to sell them all for 1 dollar a piece, how many dollars did he want to get?reference: PhET, Math Forum, Khan Academy
Re: Temperature and heat. A man holds a bucket filled with 8 quarts of ice water. He pours hot water into the bucket. How many quarts of hot water will the man need to add to the bucket to bring the water up to 20°C?answer: How much liquid did the man add to the bucket? ** As the man added 16 quarts of water, the total water in the bucket was 24 quarts, so there were 4 quarts of ice water added. liqui*cup=quart so#

The second mole of weight lost is (60 - (62 - (48 - 27))) = 7How many kilograms did each of the two remaining people lose? ** The remaining kilograms lost is 54 + 45 = 99.The residual equation solves for 7.This entails the 7th = 2nd ** and three times the second === first ** and finally (54-45)/2 = 7.The two remaining people lost 7 kilograms each.The answer is 7 kilograms.question:#

The second person lost 7 less kilograms than the first person. ** So that means the second person lost 7 (27- 7 + 7) kilograms.How many kilograms did each of the last two people lose? ** Thus, the first person lost 27 kilograms and the second person lost 27- 7 + 7 = 18 policemen.Total kilograms lost = 103  10 = 11 meters.The answer is 27 + 18 = 45 kilograms.question:#

The first person lost 27 kilograms and the second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, so the second person lost 26 kilograms. There were four people so the second remaining person lost a total of both of their kilograms, which was 26 + 26 = 52 kilograms.How many kilograms did each of the last two people lose? ** The last two people lost the same amount, so that amount would be 26 + 26 = 52 kilograms.Therefore each other person lost 52 / 2 = 26 kilograms.The answer is 26 kilograms.question:#

How much did each person lose? How many kilograms did the third person lose? ** Then the first person lost 27 kilograms. ** The second person lost (103 - 27) = 76 kilograms. ** The third person lost any kilograms remaining after the other two people lost weight (27 + 27) = 54 kilograms.How many kilograms did each of the last two people lose? ** Combining constants results in 76 + X  X = third person, so (54 - X) = third person. ** The third person lost 7. (103 - (27 + 27)) kilograms.Remain as questions is:'= 73.question$=$ (27 + ).27 X.5 1.25question$=$ ((27 + 27) ) = (73 -3).50 X= 85.The answer is 85.question:#

How many kilograms did the first person lose? ** Let a be the number of kilograms lost by the first person.Then the second person lost 7 * 5 - 1 = 27 kilograms that were lost by the first person.Then, each of the two remaining people lost the same amount of weight, thus the two remaining people lost 15 * 5 = 75 which are equal to the first person's 14 kilograms.The answer is the weight loss of the first person, a = 27 kilograms.question:#

Let L represent the number of kilograms lost by the last person. ** Assumptn #1: The first two people lost 27 kilograms. ** Assumptn #2: The last person lost the same amount as one of the two remaining people.How many kilograms lost by the second person? ** The second person lost the same amount as the last person so: 18 + L = 18 + 2(18) = 36.How many kilograms lost by the last person? ** L = 36 - 18 = 18.The answer is 18 kilograms.Indonesian high school mathematics students'#

Each of The last two people lost a  the same amount.  let x be the number of kilograms, The first person lost 27 kilograms so 27 is substituted into the equation.Then there are  +  = 103.So x + 26 is substituted into the equation.** And then 103 - (x + 26) = 25 (keep reading).Simplifying** And simplifying the expressions produces 103 - (x + 26) = 103 - x - 26 = 25.Solving for x ** So the number of kilograms lost by the second person is x = 51 kilograms.The two remaining people lost the same amount. Let y be the number of kilograms, The third and fourth person lost 51so y is substituted into the equation.Then there are  +  = 103.So y + 20 is substituted into the equation.** And then 103 - (y +#

The sum of the number of kilograms lost by the third and fourth people is 26  Two people combined lost this amount.Define a variables ** Let C represent the number of kilograms lost by the third person and let D represent the number of kilograms lost by the fourth person.How much did the third person lose? ** Well the sum of the kilograms lost by third and fourth people combined = 26 kilograms.Do the same for the first and second persons. ** The formula for the difference is C - 7 = 27 - D.Do the analysis ** 28 = C + DHow much did the third person lose? ** C = 26 + 5 = 31 kilogramsHow much did the fourth person lose? ** And D = 26 + 5 = 31 kilograms.The total of the kilograms lost by the third and fourth people is 26. The kilograms lost by the#

What did each of the first two people lose? ** 27 kilograms, What did the last two people lose? ** Then 27 + 7 = 34 kilograms.Declare a variable ** Consequently, let x be the number of kilogram the first person lost.Equalize the variables ** Do the following so that the last two people win an equal amount of weight.Balance the equations 35 = x + 34 and 35 = x + 34.The answer is 7 kilograms.question:#
