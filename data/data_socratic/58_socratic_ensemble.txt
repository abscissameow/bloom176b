Count the students who receive $4 on the left, and the number who receive $6 on the right.These two groups expand into this division:  students with $4 vs. students with $6.The students with $4 gets the dividend, and the students with $6 are the divisor.The student requires a common divisor, which is 60.The other number is one factor of the dividend (students who are $4), so it equals their number:  60 = 3x.The unknown is the other factor of the dividend (students who are $6), so 3x = 60.Redistributing the negative signs: 3x = -4.Add 3 to both sides to remove the negative sign: 3x + 3 = -3.Substitute into the equation to solve for the unknown students who receive $4:  3x + 3 = -3, or x + 3 = 64.The unknown is one of those terms inside the#

The total money of those 60 students in a day is ** Let T$ represent the total amount of money he surveyed.The money of the total amount of money is ** Let m be the average amount of money for students who gets an average of $6 per day, and n be the average amount of money for students who gets an average of $4 per day.Then there would be 8 * $6 + 12 * $4 = 60 * (m+n) = 60 * (6 + 4) = 240$.The money of the total amount of money is $324 dollars.The answer is $324 dollars.question:#

The total amount of money the 60 students receive is 6x * x / 5 + 4x * 60 % 5 / 2 / 4 *60 / 5 = 6x * x / 5 + 4x * (60 % 5) / 2 / 4 = 6x * x / 2 + 2x * 60 % 3 / 4 / 4 = 12x / 2 + 2x = 12x + 2x / 2 = 13x / 2 = 13x = 21 * x = 255$Take your 2025 hours each month, spend an average of 10 hours per hour and you will know that during a ten-month period 22:25 / 9: h you can spend each hour or 28 hours on averageper month. Next, figure out your monthly salary (255$ / 28h = 1001$2400/month) But that was a simple problem, good luck!Useful references** Math- Cat is also a good Educational site for Maths!We hope you enjoyed the math section!

Survey for about 60 students ** So now the size of the sample is 60.Survey for about 6 students ** Im assuming that the students are 1- $6 daily allowance 2- $4 daily allowanceSample of 10 students for the population ** What I know is if you take 10 students the result will be $40 average for daily allowance.Population mean = 57 students ** Because now all students are of about 6 students sample.So, total money students would get in a day ** If all of them get 57 the money in a day at the middle school.Therefore, the student should increase ** The student has to increase the sample size of 60 to 100 and take a mean of daily allowance.The answer is the average number of dollars, $1*60= $60.question:#

Sum of total dollars per student = $2 * 2/3 + $4 * 1/3For the middle school students: $(6/2*29) + (4/3*31)=6(*1)/9 + (3*2)=45The answer is 45.question:#

Let b be the amount that the 60 middle schoolers get in a day.** Then the total amount of money the 60 students receive in a day is the average amount they receive multiplied by the number of students, which is (2/3)*60 + (1/3)*60 = 46.5*60 = 3276.60 dollars.simplify it ** Therefore, the total amount of money is 2103.80 dollars.write an expression ** Then the expression is b*x + (1-b)*x, where x is the total number of middle schoolers and equal to 60.Simplify ** Simplifying produces 62, and 45 = 3*16, so x = 15, and b = 3276.60/15 = 202.67, and the final answer is 3x + x + b = 3276.60/15 + x + 202.67 * x = 3276.60/20#

Define a variable $$ Let x6 be the number of students that receive $6 of allowance a day.$$ Let x4 be the number of students that receive $4 of allowance a day.How many students receive $4 in allowance a day? ** So the number of students with $4 allowance per day is The total number of students multiplied by the number of students that receive $4 per day.How many students receive $6 in allowance a day? ** So the number of students with $6 allowance per day is The total number of students multiplied by the number of students that receive $6 a day.How many students receive $6 a day? ** And since there are only two numbers, there is just one 6.Therefore, the 4 ones are divided by two.The answer is 98 * 2 = $196.question:#

Find the average allowance of each of the two groups ** Let A be the average of the first group and B be the average of the second group.How many students got an allowance of an average of $6? ** The first group consisted 2 * 2/3 = 2 * 0.6666667 * students who received $6 per day.How many students got an allowance of an average of $4? ** The second group consisted + 1 * 1/3 = 1 * 0.3333333 * students who received $4 per day.Average daily allowance ** The average amount of the daily allowances for all of the students is A + B.Total amount of the money those 60 students got in a day ** The total amount of the money received per day is 60 * A + 60 * B.Simplification ** Put the same symbols together so 60A + 60B is equal to 60A + 60B.Equal to the#

Since about 2/3 of the students get $6 per day, these students average $4 per day because these students get $4 per day + the other 1/3 students get $4 per day = $6 per day.**	43% of 60 created the variables **	30studentsx6 = 180 ; 30 students get 180$ daily** 6% of 60 changed the variables **	40 students get 170 daily** 17% of 60independent variable	independent variable	For solveng this beter must ten use ** 300 = 60 % (1/2 * 30) + 40 % (1/2 * 4) i.e. (30 * 6) = (1/2) * 300 and (4 * 6) * (1/2) * 100 = (1/2 * 300)All contribute to get an amount of 300$ per day.question: How many newspapers will Mr. Box buy from the newsstand for 2 for 5?** He's buying 2 for 5, so the most he'll pay is 5 x 5 for 10, with 11 newspapers remaining#
