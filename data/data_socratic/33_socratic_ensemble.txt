What is Kimber looking for? ** She needs the number of ingredientsTotal together the ingredientsKimber needs to make the pizza ** Kimber needs to make the pizza. The combined total would be 10 cups + 16 cups + 1/2 (times) as many teaspoons + the numbers of cups of flour.Rewrite the combined total as one number ** So we need 1 + 10 + 16 + 1/2 = 23 cups when counted all together to make the pizzas.Divide by 1+16+ 1/2 ** Then 23 would be 10 x 16/(1/2 + 1) cups. Divide all of the ingredients total by 1, 16 and 1/2.How many cups of each of the ingredients do Kimber need? ** And the new expression would be 10 x 16/(1/2 + 1 x 16 + 10) cups = 12 x 16/(5 + 4) cups = 7 x 8/(4+4) cups = 36/4 = 9 cups.** This means we needed 9 cups of#

32⁄2dcup salt times the number of cups of flour would be (1/2 ×2 cups): (1/2 × 9 cups) = 2⁄3dcup salt.The answer is 2in32s.#

** Let W = the number of cups of water, F = the number of cups of flour, and T = the number of teaspoons of salt.Physical Tens ** So thats 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 1/2 * (16 No. of cups of flour) = 8 cups of saltTeaspoons of salt ** So thats 160 cups of water, 256 cups of flour, and 272 teaspoons of salt.Math Expressions ** For the total combined total number of cups of water plus cups of flour plus cups of salt is 160 + 256 + 272.The answer is 640 cups of water, 640 cups of flour, and 240 teaspoons of salt.#

** The total number of cups = 10 + 16 + 1/2 x 16 x 1 teaspoon of 1/4 cup of salt.First, we seek the value of the teaspoons of salt. ** 16X1/4 = 16/4 = 4 then 16/4 = 4 cups.Rounding off to the nearest integer ** Then 4 divided by 4 comes to the integer 1.While keeping the cups of salt and flour constant, change the teaspoons to cups ** Then 16 x 1 = 16 then 16 = 1 x 4 teaspoons.Divide by 4 ** The four cups 16/4 divided by 1 = 4 cups.We now seek the 16 x 1/4 = 16/4 x 1/3 teaspoon of teaspoons of 1/4 cup of flour ** Divide 16 into 4 = 4 cups of flour4 x 1/3 ==> 4 X 1/3 = 4X /2 teaspoon of saltThe resulting combination  ** So the answer is 1/2 x 4 = 4 teaspoons = 8 cups.The answer is 8.question:#
