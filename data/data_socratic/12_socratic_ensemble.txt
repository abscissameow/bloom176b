Define a variable ** Let x be the number of trees.x = mango trees kelapa treesHow many trees does Randy have in all on his farm? ** Then number of trees Randy has would be mango trees + kelapa trees + xThe answer is 90 trees.Final ScoreYou scored %%SCORE%%#

How many trees does Randy have? ** Let X be the total number of trees.Then the number of mango trees is [X - 5/2*X] / 3=3*X - 15 = X-15.Write an equation ** Likewise, the number of coconut trees is [X - 5/2*X] / 2 = 2 * X - 20 = X -20.Simplify ** Thus, the equation becomes X=30.Divide by X ** Now the value of X - 6 = 15 - 20 = -5 trees.The answer is -5 trees.question:#

Write an equation using constants only ** Let A be the number of mango trees. Let m be the number of coconut trees.If A = mango trees. Then m= No. of coconut treesA + m = 60m = 36Required No. of mango trees ** The number of mango trees = m + (m/2) = 5/6 m = 5 x 36 = 180Required No. of trees ** The total number of trees is sum of mango and coconut trees = Indians and Coconut trees = 185 trees.The answer is 185.#

Let M be Randy's number of mango trees.Let K be Randy's number of coconut trees.Write both equations ** Then 5M and K coconut trees, where M= K.36 = K + 12 ** K = 36/5 = 6 coconut trees.Make a curved arrow from an equal sign to the other = 6 mango trees.Solve for K ** Add K to both sides K - 6 coconut trees.Two equations, two unknowns ** Thus, KM = 60 + (5x6) - 26 = 26 mango trees.Retain constant 60 ** Then K + (M-60) = 26 mango trees. solve for this M + 26 mango trees.The answer is 26 mango trees.#

efine a variable B that represents the number of coconut trees.    Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.That means he has 5 more than half as many trees as mango trees.Write a second equation    Randy has X more coconut trees than mango trees.SimplifyingProduction ** That means he has 50 -20 = 30 more coconut trees.Taking half the total in mangoes    Then from 30he will take half so he took 15 coconut trees.Combine equalities ** From this, we get 80 - 30 = 50.We know the number of mangoes    Then we know that the number of mango trees is 80 - 1 = 79 mango trees.The answer is 79.question:#

Therefore, the number of all trees planted on Randy's farm is 60 + 5 = 65.The answer is 65.question:#

How many mango trees does Randy have? ** 100 in all = 60 mango trees + 5 half coconut treesHow many coconut trees does Randy have? ** 5 mango trees = 5 half coconut treesTimber A=Timber B ** 5 half coconut trees = 3 coconut treesFrom A = From B ** 60 mango trees = 30 mango trees timberHow many trees does Randy have? ** 30 mango trees + 30 coconut trees = 60 trees in all.The answer is 60.#

Demonstrate the number 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.Convert to all integer numbers ** Let n be the number of coconut trees.Then, 5/2 * n + 5/2 = 2 + 5 = 7 (mango trees)Convert the whole numbers to all integer numbers ** so that 2 is all integer numbers must be 2Add the integer numbers together ** so that the total number of trees must be 7 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 0 = 14 (trees).To find out how many trees in all on Randy farms, count the all integer numbers and convert them to all integer numbers that is 14.The answer is 14.The sum of two like#

Randy has 60 mango trees x 5 = 300 coconut trees is equal to the difference of trees.Write an equation ** Now to write the equation:300 coconut trees is equal to the difference of trees.Define a variable ** Let C be the sum of the number of trees.Write the equation ** 300 coconut trees is equal to C + 60 mango trees; we change 300 coconut trees into 300 - C.Simplify ** So we simplify 60 mango trees to 60 C, and 300 - C.30 mango trees is equal to 30 C.Divide both sides by 2 ** 60 mango trees is equal to 30 C / 2 C, and 30 mango trees is equal to 15 C,C = 30 / 2 mango trees = 15 + 30 mango trees = the total number of trees on the farm.The answer is 60.question:#

How many coconut trees does Randy have? ** Randy has 10 times as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many? ** So he has 5 * 10 coconut trees. How many in total? ** Therefore he has 10 + 5 + 60 mango trees total.The answer is 70.#
