How long is each piece? ** Let x be one of the pieces.By inspection ** One piece is 4 feet by 6 ft.2x2 ** Thus there are two of those, and 2x 2x2 +2x2 2x2x2 =62x1 ** The other piece is 2 foot by 4 feet.2x ** So there are two of those, and 2x 15.8 + 3xx4 16x12 ** The bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet.16x12 ** And as those become 82x12 feet.Now ** 16 32 32 feet by 12 feet.16 32x12 16 32x4 245 feet ** Therefore the sum of the areas of all three pieces are 245 ft2.The answer is 245.question:#

How much fabric is bagged in the living room? ** 4 x 6 = 24 feet.Therefore, the n meters of fabric in the living room is n = 16/24 = 0.625 yards.How much fabric is bagged in the bedroom? ** 2 x 4 = 8 feet.Therefore, the n meters of fabric in the bedroom would be n = 16/24 = 0.625 yards.How much fabric is bagged in both rooms? ** Adding them the expression would be 2 x 0.625 = 1.25 yards.How many yards of fabric would be leftover. ** So the yards of fabric leftover would be 1.25 - 0.625 = 0.625 yards.The answer is 0.625 yards.question:#

How much fabric is left at the end? ** Then the total number of squares is 4*6 + 2*4 = 40.How much fabric is left at the end? ** The original amount of fabric squared is 0.16*12 = 0.192.So the fabric left is 289 -0.192 = 269 square feet.The answer is 269.question:#

Lets define L as the length of the bolt of fabric in feet and W as the width of the bolt of fabric in feet. If L = X and W = Y, then (4 x 6) x (2 X 4) x12 X 16 = (4 x 6) x (2 X 4) x12 X (16 X 16)2/3 = 162/3 + 112 = 84 feet.Therefore, the amount of fabric left in square feet is 84.The answer is 84.#

The 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle goes straight across in the material.The 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle is smaller than the first one. Therefore, it provides half as much.** 5/2 feet times the rectangleIn total Ann buys 12 feet of fabric times 5/2 ** 60*1/2 + small rectangle = (4*2)(6*2) + (2*4)(4*2) = 2*4*6*2*4 = 40*4 = 160 In feet 160/12 = 16The room looks like 16 small squares times 16 large squares = 256 little squares.Each square is 1 inch by 1 inch therefore there are 256 sq in by 256 sq = 5488 sq inch.(To convert inches to sq inches, multiply 1 inch by 1 inch = 1 sq inch, a 2 inch x 2 inch by 2 squd inches = 4 sq inchesBack to contents page Share | Email | Print | Font size: a>A + a>B + a>C = a>A + + + + =#

Define a variable ** Let x be the total amount of fabric left. Determine how many square feet there is in the fabric bolt ** then there are 16 x 12 = 192  you want the square feet in the fabric cut by  the room. Square foot of living room is 16 x4 =   w 3  x 12 of bedroom is  2  w 4  x 12  Then the square feet in the fabric cut by  the room are 16+4 =  18  3 But since we have a 4 x 6 for living room we need to subtract 4â€”6 =  2  3 Determin drag the this 4 and  six to make into a 2 x 6 so you can divide by 2. Square feet of living room +4+6+2 x6 =  9  3 Square feet of bedroom +2 x 4x2 =  8  3 Square feet of living room a9 ers 18 x 9/18 =  18  square feet of bedroom 8 x 8/8 =  9  Then line 1 =  18  + 9 = 27  the square feet of fabric are 16 x 12 = 192#

How much fabric is left in square feet? ** Define variable ''a'' for the amount fabric that is left in square feet.Find number of cut parts in square feet ** Ann cuts for the bedroom 12 ft - 2 ft = 10 ft The amount for the bedroom is 10 x 4 ft = 40 ft The amount for the bedroom is 40 x 12 ft = 480 ft for both curtains.Subtract by 16 ft ** The amount for the living room is 16 x 6 ft = 96 ftThe amount for the living room is 96 ft - 4 ft = 92 ft the total amount of fabric cut by Ann is 40 ft + 480 ft + 10 ft + 30 ft = 300 ft for both curtains.Subtract by 1 ft ** The amount for the curtains is 300 ft x 1 ft = 300 ft in square feet.The amount for the curtains is 300 x 4 = 1200 ftThe address is 1200 ft - (300 * 2 = 600 ft) for both curtains.The address#

Define a variable ** Let E be the number of square feet left.How much fabric is left in square feet? ** So the expression would be E = 16*12 - (4*6) - (2*4).Simplify ** Now the material E left would be 16*12 - (4*6) - (2*4) = 16*12 - (2*12) = 10*12 = 300 square feet.How much fabric is left in square feet? ** The answer would be E = 300.The answer is 300.This accounts for over half of all possible tenth grade#

How much fabric is left in square feet? ** A is the number of leftover square feet.16 x 12 - (4 x 6) - (2 X 4) = A.write an equation ** Simplify the equation.12 - 12 - 12 = A.Divide by 3 ** 2 + 2 + 2 = A.Subtract 2 from both sides ** Remove one twotwo ** 2 - 2 = A + 2 =
Since Ann cut a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for her bedroom curtains and a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for her living room curtains, thus she cut twotwo 2 + 8 = A + 2 --> 2 - 8 = A-2 square feet of material. The final answer is 11 square feet left over.To round this to#

alit ** Let a be the number of feet by square feet cut for the living room, and b be the number of feet by square feet cut for the bedroom.How much fabric is left in square feet? ** The fabric remaining must be your bolt with 16 feet - 2a -12 feet - 2b in square feet.How much fabric is left in square feet? ** Therefore, you must have 16 - 2a - 12 - 2b = 16 in square feet.Simplify ** At this point you need to leave your rooms as a and b and combine constants to produce 12 = a + b.How much fabric left in square feet? ** In square feet = 16a/b - 16b/a.Simplify ** Thus, the fabric remaining is 16a/b - 16b/a = 15b = 32b/a.The answer is 4b = 32b/a.question:#
