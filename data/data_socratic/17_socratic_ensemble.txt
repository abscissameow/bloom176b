The total number of hard hats initially ** Hard hats = Philips = 100 % = (6x pink + 6x green) + (4x green + 4x pink) + 4x yellow = 2 + 7 + 4 + 4x yellow = 19 + 5x yellow.The total number of hard hats ** The total number of hard hats that Carl and John took away** Hard hats = 19 + 5x yellow - Carl - John** Hard hats = 19 - 4 - 6** Hard hats = 15 - x - 2.How do you calculate the number of balls## strawberries** Hard hats = 15 - x - 2.How much he takes away We can calculate Carl number of hard hats ** Hard hats = 26 - x ** Hard hats = 26 - x - 2 then, ** Hard hats = 26 - x - 4** Total number of hard hats ** # of hard Hats = Philips = 100% = (6x pink + 6x green) + (4x green + 4x pink) + 4x yellow ** Hard hats#

How many hard hats did they take? ** Let P be the number of pink hard hats that were taken by Carl and Q be the number of hard hats that were taken by John.Then 26 - P = 20 pink hard hats remain as well as 15 - Q = 8 green hard hats remain.The number of hard hats that remain is 26 - P - Q = 4 + 8 + 15 - 26 - P - (Q - P) = 12 - P - Q + WThe answer is 12 - P - ((P + Q - 4) - Q) = 8 - P + (P - 4) - P = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0The answer is 58.The correct answer is 58.question:#

From the information given, the easiest way to find the answer is to initially write the equation ** Then solve for ** And the number of remaining hard hats is ** Finally, the answer is ** Assume that the truck contained x hard hats overall ** And when Carl removed x/4 hard hats, John removed 2x - is the number left after Carl removes 4 of them from the truck? ** And what is the expression for the number of remaining hats? ** Simplifying ** Adding x to both sides ** Now, the total number of hats is equal to the original number of hats minus the number of hats taken by Carl minus the number of hats taken away by JohnSubtracting 3 from both sides will bring Johns hard hats removed to the same side as Carl and#

Understand the puzzle __________ ** If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats and John takes away 6 pink hard hats, calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck __________ ** The first thing to understand is that John takes away 6 * 79 = total number green hard hats that remain = 52  ** The total number hard hats = 26 + 15 + 52 = 79  ** And the total was 25 + 15 + 52 = 79  When John took away 6, how many more green hard hats remain in the truck? ** When John took away 6, there were 15 green hats less and then there were 6 more green hard hats.Subtract the later from the former ** Therefore, the difference is 15 + 6 = 21 green hard hatsThere are 21 more green hats than pink hats ** Since there are 21 more green h#

Three colors total, formulate the percentage of each color hard hats ** The total number of helmets is 86  The percentage each color is 26%, 21% and 47% respectively. Formulated the equation of the equation ** Total hard hat = green helmet + white helmets -(4 pink helmet + 6 white helmets) The percentage each color is 26%, 21% and 47% respectively. Answer in percentage:1/4 x 26% + 3/4 x 21% + 26/4 x 47% = 74/4 = 17.25 The#

Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck was 26+4-15+6*2=25 hard hats.The answer is 25.question:#

First calculate how many hard hats will be left after John removes 6 pink hard hats. Let R be the number of hard hats remaining in the truck after John removes 6 pink hard hats. Write an equation ** If R is the number of hard hats remaining in the truck, then ** 26pink - 6 and green = number of hard hats remaining in the truck ** Therefore, R(26 - 6) + 26g = 26p - 6p(-26*6) + 26g  = 26p - 6p + 8g =  R(26 - 6) = 26p - 8p + 12g =  R(26 - 6) + 26g = 26p - 8p + 26g - 8p  = R(26 - 6) + 26g =  R(4p + g - 6p) + 26g =  24 + 26g =  R(4p + g - 6p + 4g) + 26g  = 26p + g - 8p - 4pg + 26g  = 26p + g - 8p - 4pg + 26pg = 26p + g - 8p - 4pg + 26pg  = 26p + g - 8p - 4pg + 26pg = 26 + 8p - 4pg + 26pgHow many hard hats remain#

Since both Carl and John removed pink hard hats, you can calculate the total number of pink hard hats by adding both boys' number to get the equal removal of pink hard hats 54 - 2x = 12 pink hard hats remaining, where 2x is the number of hard hats that each removed.2x = 7 hard hats removed 2 times, and so the total is 7x11 pink hard hats remaining.The answer is (7x(25)) = 150 = 11x25.question:#

The total number of hard hats that remained in the truck. ** The total number of hard hats in the truck was 26 + 15 + 24 = 61.Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats. ** Define a variable ** Let C be the number of pink hard hats that Carl takes away.The total number of hard hats that remained. ** Thus C is the portion of 61 hats that Carl takes away.Next, John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hats than the number of pink hats that Carl removed. ** Let G = total of number of green hats taken awayDavid takes away twice as many green hats than the number of pink hats. ** Thus G is 6 + 2*6 = 2*10.Plugging in for G ** Finally, the total number of hats remaining in the truck is C + 2*10#

Total number of hard hats in truck = 4 + 15 - 6 = 3 + 12 = PI:KEY pink hard hats - same times as green = -12 eggs then subtract 24 yellow hard hats = -24 yellows =12XI need to write an expression that is a constant The number of hard hats each person removed.  Therefore, if we had an expression that is constant, we have,Harry lost 4SPickard lost 6EgsAte 2x more than pickard lost - 14 - 6 = SPickard lost - 14Go subtract - Pickard immediately lost  Pickard lost - 14 - 12 =Green was 2 more SPickard lost - 14 - 2x = Green was 2x, therefore the position is Pickard lost - 14 - 2x =Green was 2x, plus 2 SPickard lost - 5 = Green was 2xHow many eggs were lost?Yellow was 2x eggs lost, so the remaining 12 eggs rounded up, so we are left with 12 whites and#
