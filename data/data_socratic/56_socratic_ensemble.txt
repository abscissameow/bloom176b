How many minutes Leo finished the first part? ** First, write as if it is a fraction and show the numerator and denominator.He finished the first part in 25 minutes. 76 ÷ 3 = 25 minutes the first part.How many minutes did Leo take to finish the second part? ** So Leo finished the second part in ((76 ÷ 2) x 2) = (76 x 2)/ 2 minutes to finish the second part.How many minutes did Leo finish the third part ** Leo finished the entire assignment in (76 + 40) ÷ 3 = 112 ÷ 3 = 33 minute.The minute becomes (40 ÷ 3) + (25+33) = 26 + 26 = 52.the third part of his assignment? ** the answer is 52 minutes.The answer is 52.question#

					Let	c be the number of minutes used to finish the first part of the assignment. Let x be the number of minutes Leo used to finish the third part of the assignment.s 	* First Part completed = 25 minutesc * Second part = x minutess + c = 25 minxt * Third part = 2 hoursc * Third part = 2 hours x minutess = 2h*c*x						Therefore25 + x = 2 hoursc = 2x				And25 + x = 2h * 2xc = 2h * x				Simplify25*(2h) = 2*(25 + x) = 2x + 25 + x	Multiply by 4!\s+25 objects in it. Although it is not known how many there are to beeg25*(2h) = 4*(2x + 25 + x)	Subtract 2x!The answer is x = 15.question:#
