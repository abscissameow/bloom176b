How much does he spend on food? ** Let the unknown be C. So 1000 x 0.2 x C is his budget from food.Outline an equation ** So the equation is C + 1000 x 0.15 + 1000 x 0.25 = 1000 x 0.4Simplify the terms ** Which gives 0.25 (C + 0.15 + 1000 x 0.25) = 0.4Simplify the terms ** Which yields 1000 x (0.4 - 0.15 - 0.25) = CSubstitute for the first term ** Which gives 1000 x (4 - 0.15 - 0.25) = CReciprocal for each term ** Hence the budget for food is 4 / 1.25 â€“ 0.25 = 3.133 How much does he spend on food? ** Thus, James spends $330 on food for the semester.How much money does James spend on coursework materials? ** Moreover the budget for course work materials is 1000 - 330 = 680.The answer is 680.With all the Wolfram|Alpha Answers#
