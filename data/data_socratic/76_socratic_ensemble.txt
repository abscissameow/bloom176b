Composing a term 197 + 30 equals 237. How many vegetables were produced by the garden? ** As 60 is subtracted from 127, so cucumbers were produced by the garden 127 - 60 = 77 vegetables.How many vegetables were produced by the garden? ** Then peppers were produced 52 times as well: 77 * 2 /1  = 77 * 2 to 1 = 157 45 45 to1 = 157 * 1/2 equals 157 - 45 = 107.How many vegetables were produced by the garden? Similarly, as 247 * 117 = 254 * 2/3, and 254 * 2/3 equals 254 * 60 = 139 + 45 = 174 cucumber + pepper.How many vegetables were produced by the garden? ** Therefore, the total vegetables produced by the garden is 217 elastic.The answer is 217.question#

Define ** Define the sum of the potatoes and peppers.Define ** Let the sum of potatoes, peppers and cucumbers be y.Make an equation ** The equation is y + 60(C) + 2(C) = 237Potatoes = 237 - 60peppers ** And the number of potatoes left is 237 - 60 = 177and 1  function 8 with  ** 107  ** The number of peppers is 237 - 60cucumbers ** Let C be the number of cucumbers.Then 1 - C = 54/7 ** The equation gives 1  function  ** And there are 87  ** And the equation gives 7 *  ** Now use Math to find the  answer ** 2x + 237 + 2( x)= 54Write an equation ** Make an equation for the number of cucumbers y as a function of x.Simplify ** Divid#

How many cucumbers did the garden produce?  ** Let c be the cucumbers.  Let p be the peppers.The garden produced c + p------| ##------^c = 237 - 60 - 2*c.c = 45 peppers            ######################p = 237 - 60 - c  50 no. peppersp = 60.         ##############################Then the garden produced c + p = 45 + 60 = 95 vegetables.         ##################Answer 95.question:#

the garden produced? ** So we have to find which number substituted for x will equal 217 and the unknown will have to equal 237.Thus, 237 = x + 60 - 2x.solve: * Subtract 60 from both sides to eliminate 60 to get 217 = x - 2x+2.divide by 2 ** And we divide both sides by 2 to get 117 = x - 2x to get 117 = x - 2x(117)'s LCM is 117 ** And x = 117 / 2 = 57so we got 217 as the imaginary number answer.The answer is 57.question:#

Calculate the capital stock variable ** Let x be the equal number of cucumbers that the garden produced.Calculate the capital stock variable ** We x that the garden produced 60 less cucumbers than it produced.Calculate the capital stock variable ** Therefore, the garden produced 10 more cucumbers than the garden produced.Calculate the capital stock variable ** Since B is twice fruit of x, B = 2/x.Calculate the capital stock variable ** Combining constants produces x + 15 = 10.Calculate the capital stock variable ** Then the expressions in the question simplifies to x = 15 vegetables.The answer is 15.#

Produce a variable **  Let P be the number of potatoes produced by the garden. Looking for a pattern **  The number of potatoes and the number of cucumbers are different by 60.Create an equation **  A number (C) of cucumbers was produced. So x - C = 60.Combine equal terms **  x - 60 = 60-40 = 20Supply the first number missing from each statement **  x = 60 + 20 = 80The garden produced 237 potatoes. There are 80 fewer cucumbers. The cucumbers were twice as many as the peppers. How many vegetables were produced? **  x, the number of cucumbers was found. So the number of cucumbers is x + 20 = 80 + 20 = 100.I already revealed the number of cucumbers. What about the pepper count? **  This does not depend upon the number#

So the number of vegetables produced must be 237 - 60 - 2 = 141 fruits and vegetables.Thus, the garden produced 141 fruits and vegetables.question: Ray makes mud pies three days a week.

use the additive identity property.To produce a garden, you have to plant _____ potatoes. ** Therefore plant 237 potatoes because there are 237 more potatoes than cucumbers.To produce a garden, you have to plant _____ cucumbers. ** So plant 60 cucumbers because cucumbers is 60 less than potatoes.To produce a garden, you have to plant _____ peppers. ** Peppers are 2 times as many as cucumbers so plant twice as many peppers.There are 237 more potatoes than cucumbers, 60 less cucumbers than potatoes and 237 potatoes. (237 - 60) potatoes produce a garden.So, 87 potatoes produce 87 cucumbers, 56 cucumbers produce 56 peppers and 42 peppers produce 42 cucumbers.remainder of all those vegetables is potatoes.Suppose 2*56 is 87.Multiply together thus 1887! = 56#
