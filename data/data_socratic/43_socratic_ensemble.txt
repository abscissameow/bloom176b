Write an equation: The number of buildings that fell with the third earthquake was: x + 4 * 2 = 0Buildings fell with the 3rd earthquake ** So for the third earthquake, the potential number of collapsing buildings is 3, since the third earthquake will make the bases less stable, so 4 higher.Put the known numbers into the equation: The number of buildings that fell with the third earthquake was: x + 4 * 3 = 0Buildings fell with the 3rd earthquake ** So for the third earthquake, the potential number of collapsing buildings is 6, since the third earthquake will make the bases less stable, so 4 times greater.The answer is 8.question:#

It takes three earthquakes for two multiples of collapse and one building for a total of four collapses. Consider how many buildings collapsed in the first earthquake. ** It collapsed four buildings. Ans so we have 4 collapses in total. So we have to calculate 4 + 2*4 = 14 collapse.It's easy to retain 3 basic four digit numbers which are 123, 321, 213 and 132. The same pattern continues for all of the other four digit numbers. When all but the last digit is next larger and the last digit is next smaller; this is a 123 pattern. To make it easier to remember add 3 from the last digit. For 321, 4+3 = 7 = 1. The number 321 will therefore look like this 1....2...3 = 321. After doing the same for the rest#

Let C be the total number of collapsing buildings after four earthquakes.Let E be the number of buildings that collapsed from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd earthquakes.Since the first three earthquakes cause twice as much damage as the previous one, the number of damaged buildings after the first earthquake would be 4*E.After the 1st earthquake, 4*E - E - E - 16 = C.After the 2nd earthquake, 4*E - E = C.After the 3rd earthquake, 7*E - E - 11 = C.Subtract C from both sides to obtain the total number of collapsing buildings after four earthquakes as E = 56 - C.The answer is 56.American Reading Tree (arr#

Rebuilding of four buildings gives B structural engineers where, B = 4Rebuilding of two buildings gives 2 * B or 8Rebuilding of one building gives 1* B or 4Rebuilding of none building gives 0* B or 0How many buildings have collapsed? ** Initially there were 4 collapsed buildings.Now after three earthquakes there will be(4 + 8 + 4) = 14Hence, after two earthquakes there were 14 + 4 = 18 collapsed buildings. Thus, the number of buildings that collapsed by the end of four earthquakes are 18 + 4 = 22 buildings.The answer is 22.#

An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. ** However, experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one because each one would make the foundation less stable.After three more earthquakes ** So consider earthquake one, then earthquake two, and finally earthquake three.How many buildings collapsed? ** Than number of collapsing buildings can be expressed as 4+8+16=32 total.The answer is 32.question:#

+3 = 1+3 + 2+3 = 6 buildings.After the third earthquake, what are the final 4 buildings?  ** Thus, the number of building collapses is (1+2+3)+4 = 6 + 4 = 10 buildings.The answer is 10.questions: Every month John raises money#

The total number of buildings are predicted to be: Number:Earthquake 1: 4Earthquake 2: (2*4)Earthquake 3: (2*(4 + 8))Earthquake 4: (2*(4 + 8 + 16))The number of buildings that collapsed = 3*4 + 4 + 16 + 4 + 4.The total number is 24 buildings have collapsed.The answer is 24.question:#

Define a variable ** Let x be the number of collapsing buildings. "How many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake? ** Adding 4 to both sides, which makes 52 = 4x. (4 x is the number of collapsing buildings four earthquakes after the first one.)Simplify ** The expression simplifies to 2x^2=52 days. (x is the number of buildings collapsing four days after.) (Days for the first earthquake plus days during the second earthquake plus days during the third earthquake equals to 52 days in total.)Divide both sides ** Thus, In other words, x^2 = 52/4.Simplify ** Therefore x^2 = 13 talk about the following step ** performing long division until the numbers simplify. therefore x^2 = 13 ( // step to be taken for every question from here because it is#

The first earthquake produced 3 buildings collapsing. The second earthquake produced just over 8 buildings collapsing. The third earthquake produced just over 15 buildings collapsing. Thus after three more earthquakes, 30 buildings would be collapsed.The answer is 30.question:#

Include the event in which 10 buildings collapsed ** 2 * 10 = 20 buildings were destroyed.How many buildings were destroyed in the second earthquake? ** Thus 20 * 2 = 40.How many buildings were destroyed in the second earthquake? ** Thus the number of buildings destroyed in the second quake was 40.How many buildings were destroyed in the second earthquake? ** The number of buildings destroyed in the third earthquake was 40 * 2 = 80.The number of buildings demolished in the second quake? ** The number of buildings demolished in the fourth quake was 80 * 2 = 160.The answer is 160.question:#
