Elsa gets 10 coins where Amalie gets 45 How many do they have together? ** Then B + 45 = 440.Elsa gets 10 coins where Amalie gets 45 how many do they have together? ** So 10 + 45 = 55 + B = 440Which of them spends 3/4 of coins? ** Then 3/4= 40, Amalie spends 40 coins on toys.How many will she remain with? ** The number of coins left is, C= B(55) = 10(40) = 37.The number of coins left is 37.The answer is 37.Lesson#

What fraction of coins does she have left? ** Let A be the number of coins taken from Elsa by Amalie. Since the ratio of coins Elsa has to Amalie is 10:45 and the total number of coins is 440, then 45*10/440 = 10/45*A. What fraction of coins does she have left? ** Writing all of the information on one side leads to A = 10 + 10/10. What fraction of coins does she have left? ** Again, writing all of the information on one side leads to 10/45 + 10/10 = 10/45 * 15/45. What fraction of coins does she have left? ** Writing this as a fraction yields 7/45.* What fraction of coins does she have left? ** The fraction of coins remaining is A and Elsa and Amalie together have 440 coins and Elsa takes 7/45 of the coins.Therefore#

How many coins does Amalie have? ** Let x be the number of coins that Amalie has.Then Elsa has half as many. ** Thus x =2 * x / 45 = 440 / 45 = 9.How many coins will be left over. ** So 9 coins - 3/4 = 9 - 152/3 = 450/3 = 145/3So Elsa has $10 objects today. ** Then Elsa has half as many. ** And, Amalie has 40 objects.The answer is 145.Question 9#

The total number of coins they have is 440 coins.The number of coins Elsa has is 100 coins.The number of coins Amalie has is 440 coins.The ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is \( \dfrac{1}{25}\)\frac{60}{50}=\dfrac{1}{5}\(for×10 & ×45\)x50x3=150.x4x2-25500=100—x1-20=30.x4=15.x3+10200=43.x+30=102.The number of coins Amalie has are 440 coins.The number of coins Amalie has is 100 + 240= 340.The number of coins that Amalie has is 100 coins.We can see that 10400 spends 3/4 of what she has.She will have 0.75 * 100 = 75coins.Amalie spends 800 on 4.5. She will have 400 coins.The answer is 75coins.question:#

The ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45.So, Elsa has 44 coins more than Amalie has. So Amalie has 44/4 = 10 coins.How many will she remain with? ** Then she spends 3/4 of what she has on toys, she has 3/4 of 10, so 15 coins left.Conclusion: Thus, the amount of coins will remain for Amalie will be 10 + 15 = 25 coins.The answer is 25.

The ratio of coins that Elsa has is 10:45. Let x be Amalies coins. The total number of coins they have is 425 and Elsa spends 3/4 of what she has.Define A and B such that x = 4 * A / 5Then x = 4 * x / 4 = 2A / 5Therefore, x = 20The coins that Amalie will remain with.The answer is 20.question:#

How many coins does Elsa have? ** Elsa has 10 coins.How many coins does Amalie have? ** Then Amalie has 45 coins.Subtract spending *** Elsa or Amalies money goes to T and toys so money to spend on Toys = B = 10 coins + 6 coins = 16 coins - Time = 10 coins - 4 coins = 6 coins.Amount left to spend on toys after spending time ** Thus she has spent 4 time but she has still 16 coins that Amalie has left to spend on toys.Amount left after spending/4 the time ** So she has 16/4 or 4 times more or 4 times as much to spend on toys than the time.How many coins did she spend on toys? ** Hence, she spent on 4 times as much as working on that times = 0.25 ofСС outlined  3Let  b T  the ideal for T *** Therefore#

Amalies has ____________coins that Elsa hasThe ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is   x / 0:442 divided by 0.45
480.0275 / 360 = 11point: 11 / 10 * 8 = 8224
The answer is 8.Transcript:#

Let x be the number of coins that Amalie has.The number of coins that they have is 440.So Amalies total number of coins is x + 45 = 45 and Delras total number of coins is 10.Amalies number of coins after spending on toys is x - 3 * 24 - 45 = 43 x = 2445 = 3/8 + 3 * 3/8 - 1/4The answer is 56 question:Duncia wants to raise ducks but have as few as possible. She discovers#

The total number of coins they have is 440 The ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 106/80. The ratio represents the slope of Carla-Elsa graph which is positive. Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys ** Thus, if the slope is positive, Amalie spends the coins in a greater rate.Let m be the slope of the Amalie- Elsa graph. The greater rate means the larger the m. Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys ** Thus 75% of 3/4 is 30/52. Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys ** Thus 10 + 30/52 - 10 + 45/80 = 4/30 = 1/12 = 0.12 > 0Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys ** Thus m = (10 + 45/80) (10 + 30/52) Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys ** wihch is 80 + 484/80#
