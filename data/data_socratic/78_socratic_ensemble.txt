Manny had 3 cookie pies to share with all 26 kids and himself. Make a box plot If he cut each cookie pie into eight slices and ate one slice, he would have 2-30 that would remain. We need to find the amount left for use in the rest of the problem. Find how many slices left ** 3 - 80 - 1(for Manny) - 8 - 8(for K-12 chiekos aa) - 6(for MOU) = 8 slices left to go to the kids.Slices can come in stacks ** 900 is split into 52 : students + 7 : orange slices + 6 : lollipops = 20 slices left over.The answer is 20.question:#

How many slices did Mr. Keith have? ** Manny, his classmates, plus Mr. Keiths pieces would be 35 pieces.Therefore allot 1/10 to Manny + 24/10 = 51/20 pieces to his classmatesHow many slices did Keith have? ** Draw a Venn diagram:†††Now Manny had 3 pizza pies, each of which was composed of 10 slices.  ♦■How many slices did Keith have? ** Manny would have 3 * 5.1/10 = 5 slicesHOW MANY slices did Keith eat? ** Therefore the number of Manny slices he had would be 5. Manny takes 5 and shares 35 with his classmates.Left over = 6 slices.Easy Question: A teacher gives 25 girls and 12 boys paper dolls. With enough pieces of paper in the classroom to only cut one doll, how many paper dolls are left over?answer: So here we have a total of 40 paper dolls. There#

How many slices are left? ** There are 10 slices for each.Each person has 1 slice. ** There are two extra pieces for each person.Each person got 1 slice. ** To give all three pieces each, total up to 10.So each gets 2 pieces - 6 extra slices. ** So 84 pieces total.How many slices are left? ** There is 10 pieces for each or 2 pieces for everyone.Thus, the number of slices remaining is 6 x 24 = 72.The answer is 72.question:#

If 6 people ate one piece, then the number of pieces left would be = 10 - (6 + 6 + 1) = 5 pieces.The answer is 5.question:#

Let p be the number of slices.  So we will have 10 + 24 + 1 = 35 slices.Then 10 + 24 x 10/p = 35 ** This will simplify to 10 p + 240 = 35.So 10p + 12 = 35 ** Take away 10p from both sides to get 12 = 25 = 2p.How many slices are left? ** This means that if p is 2, then we will have 35 - 35/2 = 35 - 17 = 18 slices left.The answer is 18.question:#

How many slices are left? ** Let S be the number of slices left.Then there was S parts of pie left.Each of the 9 parties originally had 3 slices of pie. You can multiply them each to get a total of 27 slices of pie. Let A be the number of slices in the final number of messes.** A3*27 + A3*A3 = A3*A3*3 + 27So the expression is A = 10*(3*3) = 10*27 = 300.The question of how many slices are left is S = 300 * 10% that Manny and his classmates and Keith had 27pies = 270 slices in all that remained after S was divided into slices. So the answer to the question of how many slices left is S= 270-10 +24 = 244 slices.The answer is 244 slices.question:#

This part isn;t needed for the answer format but its helpful to know his classmates ate 10x = 60 slices.There are B = [60  3  10] slices left and#

Let C be the number of remaining cookies.  We know that Mr. Keith can get C slices, so C = 1.Each student gets C slices, so 3*C = 24, so C = 4.  Each student also gets a cookie, so 4*C + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30.Each student gets 2 cookies, so 6*C + 3 = 4 * 6 + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45.  Add in the 3 of Manny, so 45 + 3 = 48.  48/19 = 3.57 rows · Use the central limit theorem to find the probability of obtaining at most a specified amount of uncertainty (error) in estimating the population mean from a random sample of size n in both classical and Bayesian statistics. • Use the Central Limit Theorem (multivariate in #2) to find 95% intervals around a linear regression line • Use 1-2 images to create a problem using either classical#

*** Remember to solve this problem first by using division by going from a fraction to an equation, then use addition on both sides of the equation.*** The answer to this problem is going to be 10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10=20   But in this problem you cant go to 20 **** so the solution is:  20/10=8   **** Erase the equal sign**** To solve the problem, step through it see if this is what you are supposed to accumulate, and if not, start looking for mistakes.See if you got them all.#
