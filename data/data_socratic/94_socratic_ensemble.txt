How soon will John finish writing a book of 400 pages? ** Let x be the number of days it takes for John to write 4oooo pages.The initial ink layer in each sheet is 30 pages. ** Therefore, John writes 30 pages every day. How long will it take John to write 4000 pages? ** Then x * 30 = 400 * 4.How soon will John finish writing a book of 4000 pages? ** Thus 4x = 400. Thus x = 100 days.And what is the thickness of 3 books that are 400 pages each? ** Thus.69 1/3 in. in each book.The answer is 100 days.question:#

Define a variable  m to be the total number of pages for all three books.Write an equation  m = 400 * 3 write down the pages they already wrote so far  so  m = 20 * 3Ask John to fill the blank   with a valid solution to the equation   m = 20 * 3Simplify   m = 2060Divide by 20   m = 10 secondsDivide by 60   m = 0.512 minutesThe answer is 0.512 minutes.#

How many pages did John write a day? ** Thus John will write 20 * 3 = 10 pages a day for 30 days.How long will it take to write 3 books that are 400 pages each? ** And John will write 10 * 3 = 30 pages a day for 30 days.The answer is 30 days.#

John writes 20x400 pages/day. 3 books x 12 days = 36 days.John writes 20x400 pages/day. 3 books x 12 days = 36 days.The answer is 36 days.question:#

Divide both sides by 20.400 / 0.5 = 800.Thus, it would take 2 books that are 80 pages each.The answer is 2.question:#

Although one book is 400 pages long, its okay to average the pages per book because this problem deals with John rather than a specific book.** There are 400 pages total, and John could write only 20 pages a day.Therefore, the number of days John writes the 3 books will be 3 * 20 = 60 days.** Difficulty: ** Find 60 and then divide by 20 to find out the number of weeks it will take John to complete writing each 3 books.Multiply by 7 to convert to weeks ** The answer is 20 * 7 = 1405/.#

Concepts: We divide both sides by 20, giving us:  284 / 20 = 14.5 days.The answer is 14.5 days.question:#

How many days will it take him to write one 400-page book? ** Let x be the number of days it will take him to write one 400-page book. 20/x = 1.Write an equation ** How many days will it take him to write 3 x 400-page books?Answer from the Algebra 2 Prep Book ** 2*(20/x) days.Simplify ** Thus, the equation#

IMO p = t * i ** And the P is 20 * the number of pages he writes each day = t.In how many days will it be 3 books? ** Let x be the number of days it takes for John to write 3 books.How long will it take John to write 3 books? ** Now the time John spends writing 3 books would be 3 * the time he spends writing all the books.Simplify ** So he has time from working for three days, then he should save 3 * the time for each book.Divide by 3 ** Therefore, x = 20 * i.stick to these problems and you will know how to solve them you are learning right now the formula for radius is a,i,r = different lengthsThe formula for volume is v = area base× heightThese are really important formulas you will need 2b √ 3 = b#

John writes 20 pages a day ** Thus the number of pages to write 1 book would be 400 / 20 = 20 daysTo write 3 books, it would take 3 x 20 = 60 daysThe answer is 60.question:#
