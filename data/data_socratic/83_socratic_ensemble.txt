Calculate the number of blue hats available. ** There are 4/5 times as many red hats as she has.Let R be the number of red hats, and let H be the number of hats for Paityn and Zola the number of blue hats.Calculate the number of hats each gets. ** Given that, 72/5 = H * 4/5=130/100.Phoebe gets R+3/4*H hats.The answer is R+3/4*H.#

How many red hats does Paityn have? ** So the number of red hats Zolhas is 4/5 of the number of red hats Paityn has. So we can say that the number of red hats Zolhas has is 4/5 *20 = 4/10 + 16/20 = 12/10+ 16/20.How many red hats does Zola have? ** Recalling that 20 = 20 + 0 of 0 hats.The equation is 20 + Zolhas red hats =.Identify each half of the equation. ** Let Z be the number of red hats Zola has.Call out each half of the equation. ** Then the first half is 20 + Z = Zolhas red hats.Remember 20 + 0 = 20The equation becomes 20 + Z = Z + 20.Invert the operation ** This is the same as 2Z = Z + 20.Multiply by 1/2 each side ** Then the equation is Z = 1/2*(Z + 20).Z + 20 = 2 Z/20 + 20/+02 + 20#

Part A:Find the fraction of red hats Zola has. ** = 7/4 (or 7 out of 4x = 7 out of 20)Part B:Find the fraction of all hats each girl has. ** Zola: 1/(1/5) + 1/(1/4) = 14/20 (14 out of 2x = 14 out of 40)Paityn: 14/20 -  14/20� = 2/20 (2 out of 2x = 2 out of 40)The answer is 2 and 14.question:#

How many blue hats does Zola have? ** Based on the fact that Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats and with the help of the statement that Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats, Zola has 20 * 4/5 red hats/ 5 red hats * red hats = 64/ 5 red hats = 12 red hatsHow many red hats does Zola have? ** Paityn has 20 red hats and Zola has 12 red hats. So 12 + 20 = 32 red hats.How many blue hats does Zola have? ** Anyways, Paityn has 24 blue hats. So 24 + 24 = 48 blue hats.How many meet hats does Zola have? ** 1/2(32+48) = 1/2(64) = 32 hats. So the meet hats that Zola has is 32 hats + 32 hats = 64 hatsSo 64 hats + 64 hats = 128 hatsMeet hats that Zola had? ** Therefore, at least 129 hats were given to Paityn and Zola combined.The answer is 129.question:#

How many red hats does Zola have? ** Let be Z be the number of red hats Zola has.Zola has 4/5 the number of red hats ** So he has 5 times as many hats as Paityn.Therefore Z = 20 * 5 = 100.so Zola has twice the amount of blue hats. How many blue hats does Zola have? ** So he has 100 + 24 = 114 blue hats.Therefore Z = 100 + 114 = 214 hats.The total number of hats is 214 for each one.The answer is 214 hats.question:#

First, lets find out how many total hats they have. ** The total number of hats Paityn and Zola have is 20 + 24 + 4/5 x 20 + 2 x 24 = 68.Now how many hats do they have to share? ** So it can be seen there are 68/3 = 22 hats to share.Each of them get their own number of hats. ** Let x be how many red hats Paityn gets.Now find the number of hats Zola gets. ** And let y be how many blue hats Paityn gets.However, it can be seen that y must be 24 - x.We know that the number of red hats Zola has is 4/5 x x. ** Let the number of red hats Zola has be z.Then how many blue hats Zola has? ** Thus, the number Paityn has is y + 24 - x = 36 - 14x + 4.
Finally, get Paityns total hats. ** Thus, the number of blue hats Zola has is x#

How many hats has Zola? ** Let R be the number of red hats Zola has. Define the variable of ** R = 20R = 20 ** a multiple of 20 hats, so Zola has t = 4/5a multiple of 20 hats, so Zola has t = 4/5 1865 =R = 20 / *6 * a multiple of 20, which means Zola has 20 / *6 * *60 * hats.Therefore D =20 / *6 * *60 * hats.How many blue hats does Zola have? ** Then 30 % 20 is equivalent to 6/6.And the red hats Zola has are 6/6 of the total hats Zola has. ** Thus the blue hats for Zola will be 10/3 of the remaining hats Zola has.This gives a value of 6/3 +10/3 = 18/3For x, substitute 18/3 in this equation 18/3 = 6/3 + 10/3As a result we have the following. ** Let y be the total number of hats Zola has; then 18/3 = 6/3 + 10#

How many blue hats does Zola have? **** Consider all hats to be 24 + 4 red, where the additional 4 must be blue.How many red hats does Zola have? **** So Zola and Paityn combine all the hats together and share them equally between themselves, calculate the number of hats each gets.The answer is 9.question:#

So 2 * 24 * 4/5 = 112, the number of blue hats that she has.She gets 4/5 times their total number of red hats, and twice the number of blue hats.  Let R be the number of red hats and B be the number of blue hats.PUAS PKN 2020 Soal, Kunci Jawaban, dan Pembahasan Matematika Kelas 8 SMP Bagian Tengah.

Zola has? blue hats? ** Let Z = the number of red hats Zola has, and B = the number of blue hats that Zola has. Then the relationship between the two is (4/5) * Z = B.Therefore, B * 4/5 = Z * 2 ** Convert fractions to decimals. Thus, Z = 1/2 * B.Calculate the total number of hats they have ** The total number of hats they have is sum of the total red hats and the total blue hats. 20 + Z = total number of red hats  expand parentheses ** 20 + Z * 2z - 24 = 20 + Z * (4/5) * 2z = 20 + Z * 10 = Z + 10 = total number of hatsSince they had equally share hats between them ** It is 20 + Z * 2 = Z * 2 + 20 = total number of hatsSo the answer is Zola 17, Paityn 15, total 38. (Make sure to give the reason why your final answer makes sense. Determine that the answer for Zola#
