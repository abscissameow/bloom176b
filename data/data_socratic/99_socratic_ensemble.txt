* 2 is the coefficient ** It is equal to 2 gallons per inch ** Thus 2 * 2 = 4 gallonsPer inch ** X equals fish measured in inches. * 2 fish are in the first ** For two inch = 2 fish ** fish this equals: 4 gallons * 2 fishPer inch ** Open Answer: 4 fish * 2 of fish is twice as Tank 2: 24 fish * 2 gallonsPer fish ** And the equals * 2. question 2: I placed 7 cats in the box#

How many bandits have in a tank? ** Let x be the number of bandits in the first tank.Gail has two tanks of water. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank.She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish.If Gail keeps two-inch fish and three-inch fish in the second tank, in that tank there are 48 x 2 = 96 gallons of water. In the tank with three-inch fish, there are 48 x 3 = 144 gallons of water.If one of the fish eats another by: x + x +...x would be greater? ** Then fish would be in a tank with 48 -x = 48 - (2 + 3) fish.The answer is 90 + 96 -2x = 136 - 2x = 78.question:#

Compare the first tank with the second tank. The following information is known: 1: There is an equal amount of fish in both tanks. 2: The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. 3: Each tank is the same amount of gallons.Go through a process and write the following information. The purpose of the middle step is to subtract the size of the tank.** The first tank is twice the size so 2-1 = 6 times the size.** The second tank has 48 gallons each so the size is 48 inches.** Then 7 inches ** 48 - 7 = 41 inches.** Thus 241 gallons of water in the tank.** Then 9 times 41 using units of gallons** Then for the first tank to be 7 times the size of the second tank because the first tank is only half full so the entire first tank has 504 using the calculation for the calculation for every#

question1 =  The answer is question + 24 = question - 24.three more fish in tank#

There are 2 x 48 = 96 gallons in the first tank because Gail tanks are 2 x 2 inch (2 gallons in the first tank. There are 317 gallons (1 gallon/3 fish x 2 fish) in the first tank. Differentiating fish from tanks produces (8 + 3) fish in the first tank. (4 + 2) fish in the second tank.Differentiating fish from tanks ** Therefore, there are 8 + 3 = 11 fish in the first tank. How many more fish would Gail have in the first tank? ** (11-2) = 9 more fish in the first tank.How many more fish would Gail have in the first tank? ** Therefore, the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish means that one gallon of water equates to a reduction of one inch of fish. So it is larger tank has more fish than the one.How many more fish would Gail have? ** And so a#

Define a variable** Let **be the number of fish in the first tank, and let ** be the number of fish in the second tank.Write an equation ** Then the sum of the fish in the first tank is 8 + = 20 and the sum of the fish in the second tank is 5 + = 25.Factorize each ** Define your variables ** Use the distributive property to distribute the, factorize, and then distribute the again.22*3*8  =  8*10*8  * 20** 10*3*4 = 4*3*20**  6*5 = 30*54Distribute the ** Distribute the coefficients and the numbers in the terms separately.Therefore ** The result is 82*45 = 8,720 fish * x 9 x 104= 8,720 fish.The answer is 8,720.question:#

Using the rule of one gallon per inch, Gail has 48/(2 + 3) = 48/(5) = 96/5 = 20 gallons more in the first tank than the second tank.Is there a second tank fish that eats one of the first tank fish? ** If there is a second tank fish, then 48/(2+3) gallons of water should be in total and there is 20.Therefore, there is no second tank fish.The answer is 20.question:#

** Since the first fish tank is twice as large as the second one is halves as large.define a variable ** let x be the number of fish are kept and double the amount reserved for the first tank which is 2x = 40.Write an equation ** write an equation x + 8 = 40 reduce it ** x + 12 = 40 divide the 2 ** x + 6 = 24 divide the 2 ** x = 3the answer is 3.question:#

How many fish have three inches of fish? ** Let F-T be what this means. Then F-T + F-S = 101.How many fish have two inches in the second tank? ** I.e. F-T + F-S + F-F = 101.Now, the extra fish are in the first tank. ** However these are still fish so these are F + F - S = 2 times 101 or 202 fish.The number of fish is 202.The answers for problem 4 are below.directions: Let's play a word guessing اللعبة الممتعة لغز الكلمات solidauto supply#
