Let x be the number of beetles eaten per day.Then x = 12 * Birds + 3 * Snakes + 5 * Jaguars = 12 * 3 + 3 * 5 + 5 * 6 = TableA * TableB * TableC.Simplify ** Then x = 6 * (3 * 3 * 5) = 6 * 3 * 15 = 180.The right answer is 180 beetles per day.question:#

Snakes eat 3 birds and birds eat 12 beetles They eat, 3 x 12 + 12 = 36 beetles The jaguars eat 5 snakes and slept eat 36 beetles. They eat, 5 x 36 + 36 = 144 beetles Divide the total daily consumption by the number in the forest and multiply by three. 6*144 beetles = 216 + 72 + 36 + 18 = 6 x 216 = 864 Divide 864 by how many days per weekthat is one dogs a day were not counted divided into 12 and get 7 the observed by this momaEach bird eates 12 beetles so they have 12 x 7 = 84they have 84/ 6 = 18 elI Jaguars eate5 e have 144 EloTogether they consume 180 el18 E 180 = 1000 3Â°0in el. can eat in elYou aim was to be ex to each other so the last one asks the smallest. question in Cantabrake: mgono, _____ 9 16!#

x represents the number of birds: x = 12 beetles day*Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. Thus, x = 12 beetles day*1 day constitutes a total of 12 (= x) beetles being eaten by these accidents.So, 6 of them therefore, can eat 12 * 6 = 72 a day.Hence, each day, 6 * 12 = 72 beetles are eaten. The total beetles eaten that day is 72 * 4 = 288 beetles.Each day, 72 beetles eaten in total. The answer is 288.question:#

There are 6 jaguars in a war. Each jaguar eats5 snakes a day. Therefore, each day, the number of snakes eaten by a jaguar is 6x5 = 30snakes.Each day,the total number of snakes eaten is 30snakes + 3x30snakes= 60 snakesEach day,the number of beetles eaten is 12 beetles/ bird x 60 birds x 60 days= 36,000 beetcEach day, the total number of beetles eaten is 60,000 + 60,000 = 120,000 beetles.The answer is 120,000 / beetles.question:#

Write an equation to represent the total number of beetles eaten. ** Let T be the total number of beetles eaten.Let us explain working out the equation ** T is equal to 12 * x, where x represents the number of birds in the forest.Combine constants ** Therefore, T is equal to 12 * 150Invert the equation ** Thus T is equal to 150*y, where y represents the number of snakes in the forest.Combine constant, where 15 * y is the total number of animals. ** Thus T is equal to 150 * 3Reduce mathematically ** Therefore, T is equal to 30 * 5Write an equation to represent each number of animals ** Then the number of beetles eaten each day is T = 150 * 5Combine constant, and E is equal to 2500 beetles.Let E be the total number of beetles eaten ** And x represent the number#

There are two easy ways to do this problem, the first solution is to use maths and the step-by-step method and in maths you can use the method of addition simply and quickly. Now, the second way of doing it is to use more structured methods and these are called step-by-step methods which are taken from the maths background and it might help the student to solve this problem using their mind with their critical thinking. So that is the purpose we have given this problem.question: Pete owns 20% of the equity of the company. What is his ownership stake in the company?answer: Pete owns 20% of the equity. Answer. The equity value is $316200 and in the#

** There are 6 jaguars so there are 6 * 5 snakes per day.** There are 6 * 3 birds per day.** Then there are 12 beetles per bird per day = 120 beetles per bird per day.** And there are 6 * 120 beetles = 720 beetles per day are eaten.So 720 beetles are eaten per day.JSON Based Quizzes are made by adding following code in the quiz.json file.schema : the json schema that should be expected for the quiz questions.question_file : the relative or absolute file path where the question to be displayed is stored.type : indicates whether the JSON based question is Book Fair or paper based question.Each Quiz should contain The JSON will be saved in quiz.json file.

Define a variable ** Let x be number of beetles eaten the that mont.Then, put the entire problem in an equation ** x = 12birds + 5snakes + 6xThen, simplify the equation ** 12birds + 5snakes = 153/5 + 6x = 153/5 + 6(153/5)The operator [+] is factored out ** The problem becomes:If 153 birds are in a flock, how many snakes can eat the birds in 1 day? ** Therefore the birds per day eaten by snakes is equal to 153 birds + is factored out ** The problem is how many snakes?Simplifying ** The problem is how many + 1 = multiple of 5, since snakes per day the number of birds is 2*153 birds eaten by every snake per day the number of Snakes is divided by 5 ** This is because a group of 6 can eat the same number of birds as can 2 groups of 153 birds eaten by every 5 sn#
