How many valuable files does he left with? **  The number of valuable files was 800*2/3 which equals 400.How many files were downloaded? ** so the 400*70% is 320.The answer is 320.question:#

He was left with 400 files - 70% = 208 files remaining.The answer is 208.question:#

How many files did Brennan download? ** Let F be the total number of files Brennan downloaded.Then 800 - F – 400 * 3/5 = 400.Divide by 5 ** Define a variable ** Define a variable ** Let V1 be the number of valuable files in the first round of downloads.Brennan downloaded 800 files in the first round, so V1 * 800 = 400.Divide by 5 ** Divide by 5 to find the number of valuable files V1 = 400 / 5 = 80.Divide by 3 ** Divide by 3 to find the number of files V1 * 3 /5  In the second round of downloads, he deleted 3/5 of the files so there are 80 * 3/5 = 240 updated files.Divide by 5  Divide by 5 to find the number of files F – V1  The number of files that remained after deleting the unneeded files#

How many files were downloaded initially? ** First he downloaded 800 filesNumber of files downloaded initially = 800 files.How many files were downloaded secondarily? ** And he downloaded 400 filesNumber of files downloaded secondarily = 400 files.How many files did he delete in the second round? ** And he deleted 3/5 of the files which was 200 filesNumber of files deleted = 200 files.The same number of files was downloaded and downloaded secondly ** How many files were downloaded and downloaded secondly? 800 + 400 = 1200.How many files worth were left? ** 1200 files were downloaded and 3/5 were deleted so 400 were withheld.Which is equal to 1200 - 400 = 800.The answer is 800.question:#

The 800 files * (1- 0.3) = 520 files were relevant.So how many files were downloaded in the first round? ** So 80 * 0.3 = 120 files were downloaded then.The statements number of new files downloaded = ^Number of old files downloaded x ^((1-% of old files deleted)/(% of old files deleted))And he downloaded 500 * 0.7 = 350.The second statement only gets half of the original files......So 520 * 0.5 = 260 files were worth downloading.Then i turned it into a fraction to do the division of the denominator AND numerator: 260 * 0.5 = 130 filesIs that right? I think i need to double that value because it is every file in round one plus round two..... did i do it wrong?**  And my division is wrong, hence why this didnt work.To begin#

Delete all 800 files again, but keep on 2/5 of the download files. Thus, 810 files are left in all.Therefore, 810 + 800 - 210 x 0.7 = (810 x 0.7) + 800 - 210 = 810 x 0.7 + 640 - 210 = 810 x 0.6 = 5130 filesanswer: The answer is 5130 files.#

Question: How many valuable files did he download? Define a variable B to represent the number of valuable files.How many valuable files did he download? ** To answer the question, multiply the number of files he downloaded by the percentage that were not deleted.So, the number of valuable files is (#

variable ** Let x be the number of valuable files that Brennan had.Suppose he has 800 files,then the number of valuable files will be 800 - x800 files that were downloaded, the number of useful fileswill be 700[x] files he has 800 - 700 - x = 200 fileswere downloaded, then they iiiiiiiiiiiiii2/5 of them were useful files, and the number of usefulfiles, now is 800 - 600 - x800 files were downloaded,the number of useful files will be 200 files he has 800 - 200 - x200 files that were downloaded (400 in total) - 200 useless files - 3x = 9.9 x 410000/ (10 - 800 x 2/3 + 400 x 5/12 + 900 x 1/8 + 700) processed files.Number of x filesthis will have 900 useless files and 700 valid files.Therefore,900 + 700 - x = 700#

How many files were downloaded in the first round?** Let N be the number of files downloaded in the first round.Then  80 * 0.70 * 100/N = 30 non-valuable files.So he was left with 70 valuable files.Thus,  30 + 100 * 0.3 * 400/N = 70 valuable files.Now using a formula that the sum of two numbers N and n is (N+5) * 0.715 = N / N+5, we get,  70 / 5 = 14.The answer is 14.#

Hint ** To get the final answer, we must add the number of files before deleting to the number of valuable files remaining after deleting. The unwanted files are all that were downloaded in the second round#
