First, lets figure out how many jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms were added.  Let j be the number of jellies beans, b the number of brownies, and g the number of gummy worms.  Let jh be the number of jelly beans to triple, njh be the number of jelly beans to double, k be the number of jelly beans to triple, and ki be the number of jelly beans. ** The total is 2 pounds worth of jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms.  Let n be the number of pounds added. ** Also, let W be the weight of the original box. ** We can write this as n(jh + 2njh) + 2g + 2(knjh -> k + jh + 2njh + 2g).** Now lets try to get more of this stuff back to a single variable.  Let a(jh + 2njh) = njh + nw.  Also, nw = y.  Now, njh + 2g = (k + y) + (n#

How much did the box weigh at the beginning of the process? ** Embed that value in a variable ** Let x be the starting box weight.How much did the box weigh at the beginning of the process? ** Then the starting box weight would be 2*x.So what is the final weight, in pounds? ** Therefore, the final weight will be 6*x + 3*x + 2 + 2*x = 10*x.Simplify the expression ** Thus the expression simplifies to 10*x = 2.Square both sides ** This also means that x = 25 pounds.So what is the final weight, in pounds? ** So the final weight, in pounds, would be 10*25 pounds = 250 pounds. The answer is 250.question:#

Define a variable for the weight ** Let W = amount of weight in pounds.Initially, the weight would be 1 lb. ** So the location on the scale when he started would be 1 lb.Next, he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. ** So the weight when he added the jelly beans would be 2 * W lb.After that, he added enough brownies to change the weight to 3 * W pounds. ** So the weight was 3 * W * W lb.Next he added 2 * W pounds of jelly beans. ** So the weight would be 8 * W lb.After adding the brownies and the jelly beans, the weight would be 8 * W lb. ** So the weight W would be increased by 2*8.If 2 * 8 = 16, then the weight * W would be 16. ** Therefore, the weight would increase by 8 * W = 8 pounds.The final weight would be 1 + 8 = 9#
