The total number of slices is: 2*N + 2*S = 2*32 + 2*8 = 48 slices. The total number of pieces is: 48 * 4/48 = 8 pieces.The answer is 8 pieces.question:#

Albert buys 2 large pizzas The large pizza has 16 slices The small pizza he buys has 8 slices Albert eats 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas Alberteats 8 slices + 16 slices + 8 slices = 40 slices 40 = 40The answer is 40.question:#

Let he has X number of slices. Then X = 4*(2L + 2S)L = large pizza = 16 slicesS = small pizza = 8 slices2L + 2S = 42 (pieces of pizza) X == 42question: A shoemaker needed to drill nine holes in the sole of a shoe. Each week he was saving 1/12 of 1/2 an hour so that after 8 weeks he had saved time for an hour. How much time did he make in the eighth week?How much time does the salesman need to drill in 9 holes in 8 weeks? * Let s be the amount of time spent by the shoemaker in each week.If the shoemaker needs to drill 9 holes in 8 weeks, how much time did he save in weeks? * Thus the shoemaker spent s*8 weeks for making 9 hole.Therefore, the answer is : 8*8*(x)**( 8/8) = 8x = the amount of time spent by the shoemaker in each week.'Therefore, the time#

Suppose he already ate 8 slices from a pizza. How many slices remain on each pizza? ** Since Albert had already eaten 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas, 8 slices will be in a total of both pizzas. How many slices remained? ** The number of slices in the pizza that remained would be 16 - 8 = 8 slices remain on a large pizza.How many slices remained? ** So the number of slices remaining on a small pizza is 8.How many pieces did he eat that day? ** The number of pieces he ate that day is 16 * 2 + 8 * 2 = 32 pieces.The answer is 32.quizquizquizquiz#

Write an equation ** Albert is wondering how many large pizzas and how many small pizzas. Let LP and SP be the number of pieces of large pizzas and small pizzas, respectively.Then Albert is wondering how many pieces he ate that day ** Albert ate LP*16 + SP*8 = 32 + 16 = 48 pieces.Put integer values in the equation ** Now the equation is LP + SP = 48 (where LP and SP can be any whole integers).Set LP to 48 and solve for SP ** Let LP be 48 and solve for SP (note: although SP is an integer number, its true decimal place or fractional value is important to know)8 - 16*sqrt(2) = 48(8 -16*sqrt(2) = 48*sqrt(2) gives the integer value of SP, which is 8.ALBERT EATS A LOT OF PIZZA!The answer is 48.question:#

Write an equation ** x is the number of pizza slices Albert is eating that day.Define a variable for small pizzas ** Let P be the number of pizza slices traveled by Albert's small pizzas per day.Define a variable for large pizzas ** Let L be the number of pizza slices traveled by Albert's large pizzas per day.limited to eat at lunch ** Albert consumes 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas per day so 16*P + 8*L = 24.define the number of slices per pizza **  Such that a large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices.only able to eat the pizzas ** And Albert can eat the total number of pieces by dividing by 16 or 8.Since Albert only eats the white slices ** Albert only eats the white slices leaving behind the#

A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices.Thus the slices in 1 large pizza would be 16, and the slices in 2 large pizza would be 32.The slices in 1 small pizza would be 8, and the slices in 2 small pizzas would be 16.The total amount of slices he ate on that day would be 32 + 16 + 16 = 64 slices.The answer is 64.#

Find the total pizza. ** A slice has 1 piece so a large pizza has 16 and a small pizza has 8.  Find the total pizza. ** The total pizza is the sum of the large pizza and a small pizza.The number of all pieces ** The total pizza is 36.Find the all pieces ** The number of all pieces is the total pizza1/2 of the number of all pieces ** Therefore, the number of all pieces is the total pizza/ 2.34 piecesSince a large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices, the answer will be 34 pieces.The answer is#

The original question was "How many slices of pizza does he eat that day?" We realize that it is easier to solve this if we convert the issues into more basic forms: He consumes 16X slices and 8X slices. 16X slices are in the large pizza and 8X slices are in the small one. Thus, 2X large pizzas are destroyed for every 1 slice in the small pizza.The variable of 16 is quite complicated and unnecessary. ** Slice notations are more readable.2 large pizzas are destroyed for every 1 slice in the small pizza. ** We will use the input as 54 - X = 88 - X.88 - X = 4 * 2 large pizzas for 1 slice in a small pizza ** So 4 * 2 large pizzas = 1 slice in a small pizza. Differentiating larges pizzas with respect to X gives 2 * lappizza / slicepz **#

So he ate 9 pizzas. How many slices would there be then? ** Say a large pizza has a variable y slices, and a small pizza has 8 slices. So 8 + y = 9.How many slices does Albert eat in total? ** Now combining beans produces 52 = y + 9 * 1/2.Simplify ** Therefore y = 12, but y cannot be a fraction.How much pizza does Albert eat? ** So the number of spoons he ate would be 52 = 12 + 9.The answer is 12 + 9 = 21 + 36 = 5*questions*question A: Albert sells 4 of his small pizza pies. Then Dominic buys 4 of Albert's pizzas. Todd buys 2 of Dominic#
