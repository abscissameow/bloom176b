Add 40 to 40 what do you get? 40+40=80= question 25% of 60 is how many% x 60 =20 Our answer is 20x=20x =20x=20x=20x = 20 students got a B and crossed the line. The answer is 20 students.question:#

What grade were students below?  ** When graded on a scale of A+ to F, students scored in the below B range had a final grade less than B or equivalent to a ranking less than B.B was Number of students that got a Final Grade Below B ** Now take the 60 and multiple it by the 40% of B grade students reply: 60 * 30/ 100 = 20 students that got a score below B.B was Number of students that got a Final Grade B and Above ** Now how many students got a final grade above B.  **Remember that A is equivalent to 15, B is to 16 or below, C is equivalent to 17, and so on.  Now, use the formula ''sumtotal = 45% * B''.Final grade = B grade students  ** Thus, the final grade is 45 students, with a final grade of B, and above.Therefore,#

How many students got below B? ** The number of students below B would be 0.4 * Grade = 0.4 * 60 * 100 = 24.The number of students getting above B would be How many students getting above B? ** Simplifying the expression produces 60 *100-40 = 8200.The number of students getting above B? ** Thus the number getting above B is 60 - 8 =52.The answer is 52.question:#

40% of his students got a final grade below B. **  40% of 60 students has 25 students got a final grade below B.How many students we talk about? ** So, we should talk about the remaining 45 students that got a final grade of B.And above ** So 54 students that got a final grade of B and above.The answer is 54.#

Divide 40 by 100:  Write an equation ** 40% of 60 students is 0.4*60 = 24.How many got a final grade below B? ** Then 24 + 48 = 80 students got a final grade of B and above.How many got a final grade below B? ** Therefore, B + 80 = 60 students got a final grade below B.The answer is 80.#

The grade requirement was B and above so Mr. Sanches will have several students with a final grade of B and more students with grades above B.Let x be the number of students in Grade 5 with a final grade of B plus above.The grade requirement was B and above so * 42/1= grades of B.there are 8 grades so using names of grades write a second proportion ** 
The x students get B and above put into a second proportion ** 
Replace the "x" on the second end of the proportions with the first "" "question. The total number of students is 240. The equation is solved as below; 8!. question. The product is 120, which is greater than 115. Question: Albert, Bartender Makes 40% Alcohol 120 liters Jack Daniels, 50% Bourbon#

How many students did not get a grade of B? ** Mr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his students got a final grade below B or 40 x 0.4 = 20 did not get a grade of B.How many final grades do his students get? ** There are 60 students in a grade so there can be multiple grades.Let C equal the number of grades that students get.How many students get a grade of B and below? ** 40x / 100 = 20 students did not get a grade of B.How many students get a grade of B and above? ** 60 - 20 = 40 students get a grade of B and above.The answer is 40 students.question:#

The Civics % that the students got a final grade below B was no. of below B : no.of studentsin months** So Mr. Sanchez found out that X*10*0.4 = Y*0.6Given X = 60 and Y = 72.20 = x*10*.20 = y*.20** Since x = 60 i=1 to 12 y = 60*.20 = 12*.20Thus x = 60 and y =12*.20 means the students who got the final grade B and above was 60*.20 = 12 *.20 = 72 answer.The answer is 72 question.#

Define a variable.  Let x be the number of students that got a grade of B or higher.How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5? ** Then 60% of x students got a grade of B and above.Write an equation.  Thus Express 60% of x as a multiple of 10.Simplify.  Thus We wrote 60% of a variable as a multiple of 10%, and so reduced it to 30% of` x.Divide by 20.  Thus reduce until you end up with x representing 20% by itself.How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5? ** And 60 / 20 = 3 which is the result he wants to solve for x and can be solved by 3 + (x * 0.3) = 60And the answer is 60 / 20 = 3 which is the result he wants to solve for x and can be solved by worst one, 5 sure and#

a variable ** Let b be the number of students who did not get a Grade B and above.So let the students who got a Grade B and above be 'a'. ** Let a = b + 40 and also let there be 60 students in total.Multiply by 40 to ** Now 40x 5* 60/100 = 2280 * 460 students.Subtract 60 from both sides ** Then the expressions is 40 - 6 = 34.Multiply by a ** The expressions gets 40 x a = 2400.Divide by 50 ** Which then a = 160 students got a Grade B and above.The answer 160.question:#
