During the first hour, its easy to guess she collected 15 coins *** Let x be the number of coins Joanne collected during the hour.Then for all the next 2 hours, she collected in total 1/2 x  + x = 20 coins.During the fourth hour, she collected 1/2 x  + x  = 25 coins.Then during the fourth hour, she gave 15 coins to her coworker (choose who they are :p) there are still left to be collected : 50 - 15 = 35.So, after the fourth hour, Joanne collected x coins from the fountain.With 35 coins still remaining inside the fountain. x + 35 coins a total should sum up to 50 coins; So was lost.Let x be the number of coins Joanne collected during the hour. x + 35 coins x - 35 coins = 50 coins.So after the fourth hour, x#

Define a variable ** Let x be the number of coins she collected after the fourth hour.The answer is 35.question:#

Thus the number of coins in the bottle is 100 - 35 = 65.How many coins did Joanne have? ** Then the answer would be 100 coins.//]]>#

Let x be the number of coins that Joanne has. Therefore x= the number of coins remaining.x = the number of coins collected x 60 - x coins given to coworkerNow, She collected 15 coins for first hour. The next two hours she saved 35 coins so for next two hours she collected 35 coins.She collected 50 coins in 4th hour. She gave 15 coins to her coworker so she has only 35 coins left. x= 23 coins.Using the condition initial value Joanne has  x= 23 coins.question: A new style of facial tissue, bright pink, has captured 50% of Judy Hicks market. If Judy sells 150 facial tissues per week, how many shades of pink tissues would she have sold this week? (Use a special form)** Let F be the number of facial tissues sold.So the#

Joanne collected ∗ ∗ 4 + 50 + 15 = = 75 coins out of the fountain inside the mall.  75 − 15 − 35 = 75 − 50 + 15 = 0 ⇒ 75 − 50 = 15 coins.During the 4th hour, she collected 50 coins.  The total number of coins she collected in four hours is 75 coins.  15 coins was spent in soda.  Her remaining coins is 15 - 15 coins = 0 ⇒ 0 coins.During the 4th hour she spent 2 + 15 = 17 coins.

Write an equation ** Define a variable let x be the number of coins Joanne collected in 1 hour.How many coins did she have after the fourth hour? ** So after 4 hours Joanne collected 4 * x coins and spent 15 * x on her soda.Write an equation ** Here, she collected more than what she spent and therefore she still has 15 * x coins after she spent her 15 * x coins on her soda.Write an equation ** So she has 4 * x -15 x coins after spending 15 * x on her soda.Simplify the expression ** Subtracting 4 * x and 15 x from both sides produces x - 4.Divide both sides ** Subtract 15 from both sides ** Divide both sides by them ** This can be done since 15 is not zero.Thus, x = 17 coins.The answer is 17 coins.question:#

How many coins did Joanne have in the first hour? ** So Joanne had 15 coins for hour 1.How many coins did Joanne have in the second to third hour? ** So Joanne had 15 + 35 = 50 coins in the second to third hour.How many coins did Joannes coworker take from her? ** And Joanne gave 15 coins to her coworker for a soda.How many coins did Joanne have in the third to fourth hour? ** Therefore she had 50-15 = 35 coins in the third to fourth hour.How many coins did Joanne have after the four hour? ** So she had 15 coins after the fourth hour.The answer is 15.question:#

Joanne collected 15 coins in the first hour ** Let x be the coins collected by Joanne.How many coins did Joanne have after the fourth hour? ** Thus Joanne collected 3 x coins during the first hour.How many coins did Joanne give to her coworker? ** Also there were 50 coins dropped so 3 x + 50= 3(x + 10)= (3x - 10) + 50 coins.How many coins did Joanne have after the fourth hour? ** And if Joanne gave 15 coins to her coworker, the amount of coins she had will be the remaining coins which is 3x - 10.The answer is 3x - 10.question:#

In the first hour, Joanne collects 15 coins.In the next 2 hours she collects 35 coins from the fountains.What happened in the fourth hour? ** Joanne randomly decides to give 15 coins in exchange for a soda?Note 15 coins + 35 coins + 50 coins + 15 coins = 100 coins.Now, how many coins did she give away? ** So we know that 15 coins were used as payment for a soda so she gave 15 coins away.What now? ** When Joanne gave 15 coins away, she would have 75 left in that particular hour.How many coins for the next two hours? ** So for the next 2 hours, she had 35 coins left.The answer is 35. This question was extracted from the New York Regents Exam Study Guide#

Define a variable ** Let x be the number of coins collected in the first hour.Define a variable ** Let y be the number of coins collected in the second hour.Define a variable ** Let z be the number of coins collected in the third hour.Define a variable ** Let k be the number of coins collected in the fourth hour which is 50.Write an equation ** Then if you would add y, z, and k together you get 143.Write an equation ** The total sum is 133 + 35 = x + y + z + 50 = x + 65 = 133 points from the fountain.Solve the equations ** Solve for x and y and z to determine the coins collected in each hour.The answer is 45.question:#
