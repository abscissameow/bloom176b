I don't know where James would get the 500 DVD, and so I didn't figure out the last part. question 1: 8 *? = 532 1 different way to solve question 2: * * *?= 14 1 different solutionanswer 1: 40 answer 2: 40 + 12 = 52hope that this helps you! good luck! At the moment, I'm too busy to give real examples, but I will be surely trying to help you anytime I can.Take care. Your tutor.PS: Please do not ask#
