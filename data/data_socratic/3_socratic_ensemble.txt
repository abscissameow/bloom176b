** Definition of A.How many pages should Julie read? ** Then A = 120/120 pages = 1 page.Julie has read 1 page. ** Julie has read ( 120 - 120 ) page from yesterday.So, she has read 120/120 - 12 = 1 page from yesterday.How many pages should Julie read? ** And the answer is A = 120 - 80 = 40 pages.So she should read 1 page each day, 40 pages in total.The answer is 40 pages#

She reads 3 pages each day. Let y be the number of pages she reads tomorrow.The number of pages read each day is 3.The number of pages that were not read is 120 - 1 = 119.Question moved.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.Moving on.Question moved.Moving on.How many pages should She read? ** The answer is 3(119)/2.#

What is Julie reading? ** Julie is reading a 120-page book.How many pages of book does Julie read? ** So tomorrow she will be reading 120/2 = 60 pages.What does 60 pages means? ** It means Julie will be reading 60 * 2 = 120 pages.How many pages should Julie read? ** Julie will read 120 * 1/2 = 60 pages.60 pages means Julie will read 120 pages, So the next day she should read 1/2 of 120 = 60 pages.The answer is 60.question:#

How many pages should she read? ** Let and., and  so that is the number of pages fines.Then ** how many pages should she read? ** Let X be the number pages she has read. Given and., is  the number pages she has read. If she wants to read the remaining pages, she must  the amount of pages that she has read.Calculating X from the data given  ** So 6 x 6= 36 pages should she read tomorrow.The answer is 36.#

Review the definition of half ** Let x be the number of pages Julie read tomorrow ** Then (120 - x) x 2 / 2 = 60 x.Review what happened yesterday ** So she read x 2 / 2 + 12 1 / 2 x 1 = 60 x.Review what happened today ** Theth question was that how much Julie should read tomorrow. question was 2x.Solve for x ** Solving the question  is equivalent to finding x.Divide by twice the number as Julie read today ** Let the pages that Julie read today be 2x.Divide both sides by 2x ** Then we get 2x 2x 2x 2x 2 / 2 + 12 Let x ** This is equal to 60 x.Solve for x ** By setting it equal to 0.Meaning that 60 x = 0.Or x = 60 is the same thing as x = 0 or x = 0 or x = 0.The answer is 60.Friday, January 31stWhat I Need To Work On ** Play#

Let A be the number of pages that Julie wants to read. Let B be the number of pages Julie read yesterday, and let C be the number of pages Julie reads today.Then C = 2 x B. Therefore, Julie will have to read C - A = 12 pages tomorrow.  Define two new variables B + A = 120 presented this math worksheet to help struggling students learn how to solve simple word problems. Solve the math equations to find a missing number in each problem. "C-D A-D A-D" or "C-D A-D" means the word "C-D" or "C-D" is the answer, which divides the two numbers that follow it. Also if both sides of the equation#

Yesterday, Julie read ** Let x represent the number of pages that she read yesterday. So x = 12.Today, Julie read ** Let y represent the number of pages that Julie read today. So reading twice as many pages as yesterday is y = 2x.Amount remaining tomorrow ** Let z represent the number of pages left to read tomorrow. ** Julie reading half the remaining pages is z = x/2.Amount remaining tomorrow ** So the number of pages that Julie read today plus the pages left to read tomorrow is z = y + x/2 = 2x + 12/2 = 4x.Amount remaining tomorrow ** The double of zinaydays is z = 2(12) = 24.Amount remaining tomorrow ** Thus Julie will only be able to read 4x phones.Therefore, Julie will read z = 12 pages tomorrow.The answer is 12 pages.question:#

How many pages did Julie read yesterday? ** She read 10 pages so she read 120 - 10 = 110 pages yesterday.How many pages did Julie read today? ** Then Julie was reading twice as many pages as yesterday so she read 110 x 2/100 = 22 pages today.How many pages did Julie read today? ** Then Julie finished reading half of the remaining pages so she read 110 + 22 = 132 pages.How many pages did Julie read today? ** Then Julie read 132 - (22/120) = 100 - 1/12 = 93/120 pages.How many pages did Julie read today? ** So she read 93/120 pages today.How many pages did Julie read today? ** Then she read 93/120 pages so the constant is k = 93.How many pages did Julie read today? ** Julie read today and she read a constant k = 93 so the variable is x#

How many pages should Julie be reading tomorrow? ** Julie should read 120/2 = 60 pages.There are 80 pages left to read, so Julie should read 40 pages tomorrow.The answer is 40.#

On the day she read 12 pages, how many pages remained to be read? ** So yesterse-day, Julie read 120 - 12 - 12 = 108 pages.On the day she read twice as many pages as yesterday, how many pages were left? ** So today Julie read 121 - 12 = 108 pages.On the day she wants to read half of the remaining pages, how many pages are left to be read? ** Then on September 18, y shall read __________ pages.The answer is 432 pages.question:#
