Let x be the number of nickels. How much are 20 quarters worth? 20 * 25cents =  Let y be the number of quarters. Then (20 * 25cents) + (y * 25cents) = $4 + x * 25cents = $4 + y * 25cents = 100cents + y * 25cents = $x + y = $100/4cents = $x = the total amount in cents.How many quarters did Alice have? ** Divide by 4 to get the number of quarters. 4x = 100 / 4cents = x = 25 quarters.How much is 100 cents worth as nickels? ** 4x * 25cents = $25; then divide by 100cents =  x * 25cents = 25cents / 100cents = 25cents /  x * 25cents = 25cents /  x = 25cents / x$ is the amount in nickels. The The total value of the coins is x nickels + 25 quarters = 25 nickels and 25 quarters.The answer is 25 quarters.#
