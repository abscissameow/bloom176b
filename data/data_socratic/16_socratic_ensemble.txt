How much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200? ** Then 300 - (200 / 2) = 150 for Mike so that the amount given to Mike is then (5*$2500) / 5 - 150 = 2500 - 150 = 1750.The answer is 1750.question:#

Therefore, without the shirt the profit would be equal to the profit after spending on the shirt.The equation prior to spending $$so the profit before spending on the shirt is $2500 question is after spending some of the share also implicit delta, but it's in the blank.after spending on the shirt the profit = $2500 x 25/? = $2500 x delta/(50 -25) So the profits remain the same, not including the shirtQuestion is try to maintain the same profit for Mike after Stephens has already spend on the shirt.$$changes, profits remain the same for Mike, excluding the shirt.$$= $2500xdelta /50the equation reduces to $$= delta /25$$The answer is $\delta$.$.$2.85 question options:GDFGDFGT#

Let the total profit be a variable A.Then, 2500 - 200 = 2200 * =1800 * Mike = 510Mike has spent 200 + 5000 = 660The answer is 660.question:#

net profit left for each person = net profit for each partner = 2500 * 1/2net profit left for Mike = $500 net profit left for Johnson = 2000 After spending $200, number of net profit left for Mike = 2000 * 5/2after-money-spent = 500 / 5 = 100number of money left for Mike = 500 - 100 = 400.The answer is 400.question:#

The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners ** According to the facts, it understand  2 business partners = Mike and John.profit from a business transaction ** It also understand  the profit is shared while doing a business transaction.According to the facts, it is known -> ** According to the given facts, $2500 is the profit of the business transaction.Also, according to the facts, it is known -> ** $2500 among $5000 from the business transaction, so it is known that $2500 = q and $5000 = 2q at q = profit.analysis at q = profit  ** Because Mike is one business partner and Johnson is the other one, its profit has to be divided among these two business partners according to the ratio 2:5 = 5x = q#

Define variables and write equations related to this problem to solve it ** Let x be the dollar amount Mike wants to spend on clothes, and let Y be the remaining money that Mike will have - after x is subtracted from 2500.How much money will Mike have for spending on clothes? ** The money that Mike will have for spending on clothes would be x + $2,500 – x.How much money will Mike have for spending on clothes? ** Now set this equation equal to 2500.Determine the cost of the shirt: ** Combine the variables ** Thus x = 2500 – 200.Then show Mike is still able to spend some money: ** Subtract x from both sides, letting Y be $2,500 – 200 – x.Therefore: ** Now he needs to decide how much money to take with him.Notice that the shirt only costs 200 so he can send a minimum of 200#

For a problem of this nature, always remember to state the question clearly!How much will Mike have after spending some of his share? ** Mike will have the remainder after he spends part of his share which means the word spend implies division.Proceed further ** Clearly, we know that there are 2 parts to the $5 and so there are 5 parts in total.Since Mike has already spent 1 part of 5 parts, there are 3 parts left to be spent which is $3. Question:  If they haven’t spent any more money after spending either 5 parts $5 or 3 parts, then what does the remaining 2 parts $5 become?question: A tank of petrol has 190 litres of petrol in it. If half of the petrol is removed and 5 litres at a time are added, how many litres of petrol will there be left when 10 litres#

If Johnson was given $2500, then Mike would had a share of this amount $2500/20  = $1,250.After spends some of his share on a shirt that costs  $200  the remaining amount for Mike = $1,250 - $200 = $1,050.$2500 divided by 20 is  $1,250C subtract from both sides  then x = 1250 - 200x = 1050The solution is x = 10.one study and medicine homework help medical homework help[/url] literature and arts homework help

The profit from a business transaction is Mike gets 2/5 of the profit and Johnson gets  5/2 of the profit -- the ratio of slash is 5/2 or 2/5 or 1/5 -- dividing the  fraction 2/5 by 5/2 -- the equal part is 1/4 -- Where 2/5 is greater -- 1/4 is 1/2 what Mike will get  (because division is performed from the right and rounding to nearest) plus the $20 which he will spend on a shirt that costs $200 -- the steps from bottom to top -- Mike will will have  $2 + 200 = $22 which rounded to the nearest without decimals is $22.answer: There are 2's and 5's in 2:5 2 + 5 = 7 like we have mentioned above number 7 is the common multiple of 2 and 5 so when we terminate a number by that many common multiple then it becomes equal for that number. For Example:=# F#

How much profit did Mike make? ** The profit is $2500 so we can write that 2500 = 2*500 + 5*250.Simplify the equation ** This equation can be simplified to 250 = 3*100 + 5 which gives us the number of dollars that a shirt costs.Solve the equation further ** Then the equation is solving for the variable 500, 400 = 3*100 + 5 which provides us with the cost to buy the shirt and we can write the equation as 500 - 400 = 100 which gives Mike $200.Final answer ** Therefore the final answer if Mike got $2500 and spent $200 on the shirt, he still has $2000 left.The answer is $2000.question:#
