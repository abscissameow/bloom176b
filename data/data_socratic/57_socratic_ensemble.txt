How many kilograms of butter were used to make one of each kind of cookie? ** Then 10/2 + 10/3 + 10/5 = 10 × (1 + 2/3 + 5/6) = 10 × 7/6 = 14/6 kg.How many kilograms of butter are left? ** So the answer is 14/6 - (10 + 20 + 3) = 14/6 - 33/13 = 24/27 kg.The answer is 24/27 kg.#

Let C be the number left over after making the three types of cookies. Let A be the number of kg of butter used to make chocolate chip cookies. Let B be the number of kg of butter used to make peanut butter cookies.Let D be the number of kg of butter used to make sugar cookies. ** First note that the 10 is used for all three types of cookies.Use a distributive property if needed. ** With chocolate chip cookies being one-half of 10, the chocolate chip cookies would be 5/2 kg of butter.Peanut butter cookies being one-fifth of 10, the peanut butter cookies would be 5/5 of 10, meaning 1/2 kg of butter is needed.Sugar cookies being one-third of 10, the sugar cookies would be 33 kg of sugar cookies#

How many kilograms do we have? ** If we take 10 kilograms, remember!

What is the remaining butter? ** Let D denote the number of kilograms of butter remaining after making those three kinds of cookies.She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. And we want to know what quantity of kilo- grams of butter, D, she left after making#

How many kilograms of butter did Liza buy? ** Let f represent the number of kilograms of butter that Liza bought.she used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies ** Half of ten kilograms is five kilograms.Which is the correct equation? ** 5kg + 5kg + 5kg = 6kg = f.same amount for peanut butter cookies ** Therefore f = 6kg.5kg remaining butter left after making peanut butter cookies ** And finally, 5 x 1/5 = 1.25.f = 6 - 1.25 = 9.75 there are 9.75kg of butter left.

During the process of making the following types of cookies one-kilogram of butter is lost. Each kilogram of butter is lost: 1/2 kg for cookies with chocolate; 1/5 kg for peanut butter cookies; 1/3 kg for cookies with sugarLook at the question ** 1/3Determine an expression ** Here we are interested in how many kilograms of butter were left after making the sugary cookies.Let x be the amount ** 10Kilogram is lost > 1/5 assessments of the remaining value. ** We can apply here is the rule 1. 5 goes into 100 what 9 times and draw 1 = x * 5 / 9So the results ** At this time x = 18  So 100 - 18 = 8Kilogram left after making sugar cookies ** This means that 18 minus one-kilogram is lost for sugar cookies and the remaining butter is 1 kg.Therefore 7 kg are left ** 100 minus#

Butter left equals 10 -2x-3x ** Let x be the number of kilograms of butter left.We can see that the number of extra cookies equals the remainder of 10 -2x-3x ** So the number of extra cookies left after making those cakes would be 10 -2x-3x- 2* (10 -2x-3x) = x.This problem is very similar to the equation 4+3x=6. So how did we solve that equation?One-half of it for chocolate chip cookies ** So 2* (10 -2x-3x) = 3 is half of a cookie.Defined a new variable ** Let y equal to 10 -2x-3x. Divided by 2 ** So then we get 10 -2x-3x- (10 -2x-3x)/3 = y/2 = y/4Who called a higher power? ** Thus we get 15 + y = 6.Trying to isolate x ** And finally 15 + 10 - 2x = 24 - 2x or 4 - 2x + x = 3.Put those values together ** So x is equal to 4 - 2x/3 or 2 - 2/3#

How many kilograms of butter are left after making chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies? ** Let C and P represent the number of kilograms of butter left after making chocolate and peanut butter cookies. Lets subtract C.Lets subtract P.The number of kilograms of butter left is 10 - P - C?** Lets add P to both sides 10 + P = C + PHow many kilograms of butter are left after making chocolate and peanut butter cookies? ** Thus, the number of kilograms of butter left is 10 + P + C.How many kilograms of butter are left after making chocolate and peanut butter cookies? ** As a result, 1 + P + C = 10 + P + C?** Because chocolate and peanut butter cookies use 2 kilograms of butter, we know that 10 + P + C = 2.Lets divide both#

The answer is  ** One-half x =0.5 kilograms of butter.One-fifth x#
