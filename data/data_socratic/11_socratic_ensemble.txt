Tobias is getting a $5 allowance a month and mows lawns and shovels driveways. So we need to solve an equation.Let ** Let x be the number of lawns.** Let y be the number of driveways.** Let z be the number of shoes. Write an equation using three variables and three expressions.Tobias earns a $5 allowance a month. To earn the $5 allowance he must mow lawns or shovel driveways.Tobias earns $15 on the 4 lawns he mows that equals 4 times 15 = 60.Tobias would earn $7 on the amount of houses he would shovel which is equal to y times 7 so 7*7 = 49.## We are given three equations3: 56 + 7y = 60;x: 5z = 9$3: (7y)=4y:4x houses that he shoveled.Toby is using money from his allowance to buy the shoes.Tobias saved#

Any negative number plus any positive number is still a negative number **  Thus $ - 5 + 15 + 7 = -23$and the result is negative 23$Multiple by $30 = -6 ** So $(-5)*30 = +(-200)$Multiple by $-15 ** So $ ( -15 ) * (-200) = +$2400 = +2400The result is positive 2400question: Five candidates from City Hall ran for the job of Mayor. The winner was the one who got more votes than the other four.  Her opponent said if all the voters are judged according to their appearance, then his total votes would be more than her total votes. So he said there must be a hidden vote. How many voters cast the hidden vote?answer: More votes of the girl than boy ** So if all the votes were counted, the answer should be positive ** So we know that for 5#

Tobias earns  Let a be money given to him for shoveling driveways.Tobias pays ** He has $15 in change, so he paid a = 15.What is Tobias change? ** Combining constants produces 7 x 4 = 28. Tobias mows 4 lawns.Tobias pay ** He earns a = 15 for each lawn mowed.Multiply by 3 ** a = 15 * 3 = 45.Then Tobias earns a = 15 * 4 = 60.

If he mows 4 lawns, he shovels 3 driveways How many driveways? ** (3 driveways mowed) + (3 driveways shoveled) =3 + 3 = 6 driveways. The solution is that he mows 4 lawns and shovels 3 driveways.question: You could cook a delicious lasagna in  The timer starts  first and then the oven turns on  You are done  Putting the oven on  is a little tougher than it looks.answer: You start by putting 1 lasagna as the first step in the woods which requires when the time required to bake the lasagna is called a lasagna cook-in-time.The next step#

Write an equation! ** Finding a relation between x and y y=4(x=...Fitting values into the relation ** When x=4 then y=20 * x+2 * x=78- There are 7 in change-1 * 78 = 7...+15 * 4 = 60- There are 4 lawns-4 * 7 = 28- There are 3 drivewaysThe answer is 28.question:#

Define the variables ** Lets define variables x as the number of lawns mowed and y as the number of driveways shoveled.Write an equation ** Work from left to right and combine constants. First 10 x 15 =$150 and then 20 + 150 = 160.Thus the total cost would be $20 + $15 + $10 + 4 x15 + 4 x 7 = $160.Combine the time values by getting the average price of service at $7.50. Now 40 + 30 + 20 = 70 = 70 + x.The shuirables require  $35. Therefore 5 x 35 +7 x 5 = 70 + 60 = $140.The answer is 140.question:#

How many driveways will Tobias have mowed? ** Multiply 15 by 4 = 60 mows.How many driveways will Tobias have mowed? ** To satisfy the equation 80 - B = $15 * 4$ where B is the number of driveways FOX wants to shovel. with $15 * 4$ equal, $8 - B = 15$.Then, how many driveways will Tobias have mowed? ** Then, 5*7$ - B$ = 15.Then, how many driveways will Tobias have mowed? ** thus, B wtis the number of driveways Tobias mowed is 7 = B.The answer is 7.question:#

The only information given is that after buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. Thus, the only unknown is the number of driveways shoveled.  And the total of money wanting after buying the shoes is $95 - $15 = $80.How many driveways did he shovel? ** So the question may be translated into how many driveways have a amount of 8 more driveways shoveled. So again, the only unknown is the number of driveways shoveled.How many driveways did he shovel? ** Thus the number of driveways was shoveled is E3 - E4 (E3 is the extra number of driveways shoveled and E4 is the extra number of lawns mowed).How many lawns did he mow? ** Therefore the number of lawns mowed is 2 E4 = 32 lawns.How many driveways did he shovel? ** The equation then becomes E4 - 26 = 8 or 2 E#

So now that Tobias has bought the shoes he has shave 95 - 15 + 4 * (15 + 7) = $20 left in his pocket. So the change Bob has left over is now $20 - 15 - 2 = $5. Roufslaas posted thinking Tobias would be such a cheap guy that he would shovel more than 4 lawns. If that were the case Tobias would have $20 and no change to leave. If that were the case his change would be $0 - 0 - 15 - 15 - 7 = $0. QED.When would Tobias be such a cheap guy and shovel more than 4 lawns? ** THIS IS ARRGH! how would one shovel more lawns than the amount of money you have? This is a summation question as the way to do question was: You would need to: 1. figure out the number of lawns he would shovel 2. make sure it was an integer so he would get it done on 3.Now will change#

Until recently, get 50% off the listed price. Use number names. ** Tobias has been saving up for his pair of shoes and its about to hit 50% off the sale price.Use number names. ** So its 50% off, 3 x 50% = 3x = 2 x = 50 / 3 = 17, and finally 177 $ / x $ = 95. Saving up each month for the past 3 months he increased by 5% each month.4 lawns and 4 driveways shoveled. ** 4 x $15 = $60 and + $7 = $67.Shoveling 4 driveways. ** At $7 per he charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel.Saving up each month for the past 3 months he increased by 5% each month. ** Mowing 4 lawns how many driveways shoveled?4 lawns = 25 x 4 = 100 $ $ 100 + 14 = 124 $ the amount saved by Tobias.Saving his money each month for#
