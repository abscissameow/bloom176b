Let x represent Alan shells.So x = Alan shells. ** Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. So x = 40.Ben shells ** Before Laurie left, Ben had collected 4 x 1/3 as many shells as Laurie had collected.So x= x (4 x 1/3) ** So we can use the Distributive Property. a (b x c) = ab x ac.So learner shells ** Thus, Ben had (4 x 1/3) times Alans shells.So x= x (4 x 1/3)RegroupingPuts this another way ** Thus, Alan had (1/5) as many shells as Ben did.So shells ** Using the fact that Ben also had 4 times as many shells as Alan did, we haveBen shells/sub. question ** We can use the distributive property to figure out the shelled collected by Laurie:Laurie shells ** sum 4 shells ** Laurie shells ** therefore, Laurie shells.The answer is 36.question:#

Let x be the number of shells Alan collected.How many times did Alan collect four times as many shells as Ben did? ** Well to multiply by 4 we multiply by 2*2 so Alan collected 12 times as many shells as Ben.How many more shells did Ben collect? ** So because Alan collected 12 times as many shells Ben collected x/2 shellsHow many more shells did Ben give? ** Combining constants gives 16 - x = 4.How many more shells did Ben give? ** Substituting variables we get 10 = 4x/2.Solve for x ** Solves 10 = 4x/2 and so x = 20 orders of shells.Alan collected shells * 4 as many shells as Ben ** (12 times) Based on this equation, Alan collected 4 * 10 = 40 shells.Therefore, Alan collected 40 shells.The answer is 40.question:#

Laurie collected 36 shells.How many did Alan collect? ** Since Alan collected a whole multiple plus one third of what Laurie collected, the number that Alan collected four times what Laurie did.So Alan collected 363 shells.How many shells did Alan collect? ** So Alan collected 4 times as many as he did so Alan collected 200 times as much as Laurie did.Alan collected 1836 shells.The answer is 1835.question:#

Let A be the number of shells that Alan collected; define B as the number of shells that Ben collected, and define C as the number of shells that Laurie collected.So Alan collected 4B shells ** and Ben collected average collection of shells is X = 36Conclude that Alan collected 4B shells = 36 ** and Ben collected C = 4/3(36) = 12Shells.Solve for B ** thus, the shells up Alan collected the value of A = B.Question answer, B = 36 - A; so the 66 - 36 A = Alan collected 66 shells = 74 shells The answer is 74.question:#

How many shells did Ben collect? ** Let A by the number of shells that Alan collected.How many shells did Ben collect?  ** So Alan collected 4 times more shells than Ben, which is 4*A.  Ben got a late start and else collected a third of what Laurie did thus 3*36*1/3 = 12.Therefore, Alan collected 36 shells.The answer is 36.question:#

All of the people collected shells.To convert decimal to fraction ** 1/10 = 1/21/7 = 2/7Since 4 is larger than 2, 1/10 is larger than 2/7.Since both components are less than 3, 1/10 from Randolph and 2/7 for Cervin form a fraction greater than 3/9 = 45/11. Since the 2/3 from the take care of the denominator, 1/21/7 from Randolph and 2/7 from Cervin equal 2 * 45/11 = 66/11.Since the people were collecting shells and they collected shells at different rates. So A = 55, B = 33, and C = 55 - 33 = 22.How did Alan do? ** Therefore, the amount shells collected by Alan would be x = 66/11 - 55 - 22 = 3/11.the answer would be 3/1 minim ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊Or It is up to you where you want to make some changes and what are#

How many shells did Ben collect? ** Add Brent things he collected:    36 + 4 /3 = 72.How many collectors could 39 shells from? ** Laurie aka 39 collectors were:       36 + 72/3 = 65 collectors.Alan gets how many shells? ** Thus Alan got 4 * 65 / 3 / 72 = 45 shells.The answer is 45.question:#

How many shells did Alan collect? ** Let x be the number of shells that Alan collects.Then the number of shells Ben collected would be 3x/4 = 9 shells.How many shells did Ben collect? ** Then the number of shells Ben collects would be (3x/4)/3 = 9/3 = 2 shells.The answer is 2.question:#
