How many bananas did each monkey get? ** Suppose the pile with 9 hands and 14 bananas had b bananas.  The remaining pile had 12 hands and 24 bananas.  Let T represent the total number of bananas. Let u represent the number of hands.  Then the total number of hands was written as b+24 = u(9+14)Inconsistent ** Because the sum of the bananas in the remaining piles does not equal 24.Therefore let the number of hands be q which needs to be found. The number of hands in each pile is equal to q(9+14).Multiply 9 and 14 and simplify and substitute each term in turn by its assigned value therefore: q(9+14) = 24 + bAP = c (i.e. 10)Rewrite this as: 9q + 14q = 120 + bAdding the terms on the right side of the equation gives:#

How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves? ** Define the variables. Label your bananas B and define the number of monkeys in the family as monkeys.Add the bananas for the 6 piles with 9 hands ** The bananas for the 6 piles with 9 hands are 6 x 9 x 14 = 666 bananas.Add the bananas for the 10 piles with 12 hands ** The bananas for the 10 piles are 10 x 12 x 9 = 1,260 bananas.Divide the bananas equally ** Subtract the more bananas from the total bananas. 1,260 - 666 = 634 or the number of bananas each monkey gets if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves is 634/monkeys.The answer is 634 monkeys. question from the nuggetbook website: question number 2 from#

Each monkey gets how many bananas? ** Each monkey gets what? ** Each monkey will get a certain amount of total bananas. ** Let C be the total number of bananas for one monkey.Certain amount of total bananas? ** Then the monkeys will get C x 12 monkeys.Adding the monkeysBecomes C * 12 + Nic * 9 + Nina * 12 *Ans = (C * 12) + (Nina * 12) + (Nic * 9) ** And there is no C or Nic terms.Let us combine all the monkeys into one term ** Thus, the term would become ((Nina * 12) + (Nic * 9)) * 12.Adding to that ** And total bananas = ((N * 12) + (Nic * 9)) * 12.Simplifying C * 12 using distributive law ** And the answer is C * 12 = (Nina + Nic) * 9.The answer is 11.question:#

How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves? ** Let Y be the total amount of bananas that each monkey gets.How many piles were there? ** There were 10 piles, meaning their the number of piles are 11.  Then the number of bananas collected were 12x9x14+9x14+12x9 = 1036.How many hands were in those piles? ** There were 6x9 = 54 hands of 9 bananas to 9 bananas, and 4x3 = 12 hands of 9 bananas to 12 bananas.So, the number of hands are 54 + 12 = 66 hands in total, so then X the number of bananas in total was 66 you had - using the equation you had that -6 + 11 = 11 and 14-x + 66 = 1036Therefore, X - 66 = 61 - 11 = 5000 so, 61 + 11 = 69 and X:0069 bananas,#

Define variables** Let x be the bananas collected per monkey.Then the monkeys will have 12 * x bananas in his stacks and at the same time he collects 10 piles he will have 10 * x bananas in his stacks.How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst itself? ** He divides his total bananas (10x) equally among the 12 monkeys.Define a variable ** Let y be the number of bananas given to each monkey.Assigning y ** That is 10x / 12 = y bananas.Changing for x ** This can be rewritten as 9y = x, and finally y = 12 * x or 12 = y * x.Write an equation ** Thus the number of bananas available is represented by a variable x.Define f(x) ** Since 12 = y * x, asign the right side of the equation to the variable f(#

How many piles of bananas? ** There were 10 piles of bananas. How many hands? ** There were 12 hands in each pile that had 9 hands each with 9 bananas per hand.How many hands? ** Now the only pile that had 9 heads was the 12 hand pile.How many hands? ** Therefore, there were 6 piles with 9 hands and 4 piles with 12 hands.How many hands? ** So 12 hands + 6 hands = 18 hands.Each monkey gets 18 divided by 12 = 1.Therefore, each monkey gets: 18 divided by 12 = 1 banana.The answer is 1 banana.The answer is that each monkey gets 1 banana.question:#

Let M be the total number of bananas. Thus Thus M = 12 x 14 x 9 = 1162So what? ** 24 x 9 x 9 = 1152, then 24 x 13 x 12 = 24 x 14 x 16 = 190 x 48 = 8400 bananas.You get 1162.The answer is 1162.question:#

How many hands of bananas are there in the total? ** There is 1*9*14 = 126 bananas.How many hands of bananas in the 1st six of these piles? ** Then there are 6 * 9 = 54 hands of bananas.The number of bananas in each pile? ** So the number of bananas in each pile will be -11*4 = 52 bananas.The number of bananas in the remaining four piles. **Then there will be 4*4 = 16 hands of bananas.How many hands of bananas are there in the remaining four piles? ** So in the remaining four piles, there will be 4 * 16 = 64 hands of bananas.The number of bananas in each hand? **So each hand in the remaining four piles will have 4 * 64 = 256 bananas.The number of bananas each monkey gets? **Thus each monkey will get 256 - 52 - 52 = 46 bananas.The answer#

The number of bananas each monkey got would be equal to __ of a hand * __ of a 7 hand pile + __ of a 12 hand pile.How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves? ** The number of bananas each monkey got would be equal to the mean of the banana count in each pile.Combining constants produces __ hand pile * __ hand pile produces 9 * 9 + __ hand pile * __ hand pile produces 12 * 9 = 12 + ___ = 90The answer is 90.question:#

Let x = bananas in each handAn expanding game: How many piles of monkeys were found to have 9 bananas in each hand? ** Let x = number of monkeys coming up with 9 bananas in each hand. And x = 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9The answer is 9.An expanding game: How many piles of monkeys were found to have 12 bananas in each hand?#
