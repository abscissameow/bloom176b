So is Bella buying the ship or snowflake? ** She is buying the ship so 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps so 9 more truck stamps than 11 snowflake stamps so 9 more truck stamps that 11 sandflake stamps so 9 =  How many stamps did Bella buy in all? ** Then in all she bought + 9 + 13 = 36 stamps.How many stamps did Bella buy in all? ** The answer is 36.#

How many stamps did Bella buy in all? ** Define variables x, y, and z as the number of truck stamps, snowflake stamps, and rose stamps respectively that Bella bought.How many stamps did Bella buy in all? ** There are 11 snowflake stamps + 9 truck stamps + 13 rose stamps = 30 stamps. The total number of stamps delivered is 30 * 3 = Which shows that there are y stamps that have a snowflake design, 10 more (1-x) worth of snowflakes are rose stamps, and the number of truck stamps is 11 (which is the same as x). We know that z = 15 - 9 - 13 = 0.Therefore, the total number of stamps is 3 * 30 * x = 90Which shows that there are y stamps that have a snowflake design, 10 more (1-x) worth of snowflakes are rose stamps, and the number of#

Define the variables ** Let X be the number of all stamps this is the total number of stamps bought. Let N be the number of snowflake stamps, and let  Can you use a capital letter to represent if it has the letters N or R in it? ** Let T be the number of truck stamps. Then X = N + 11 + T + (9 - N)T can be written as 9 (minus) N, so the two addends cancel. ** Let R be the number of rose stamps. And lets assume that N is less than or equal to 9.Since, 9-Nstamps, we have truck stamps, 9(minus) N would give us a negative number of truck stamps, so lets assume that A is negative or 9-N is negative. 9 times 9 gives us 81 more stamp, then -N gives us N away from 81 giving us 72, thus we have N equals 7.X = N + 11#

Define an equal number of symbols ** Let x be the number of snowflake stamps.Therefore, the total number of stamps # = 11 + x + 9 - 13 = 16 + xHow many stamps did Bella buy in all? ** Calling the expression to the left side of the equation determines 15 + x + 9 = 16 + x.Subtracting 15 from both sides 13 - x = 9Subtracting 9 from both sides x = 15 + 6Subtracting 6 from both sides, x = 9The answer is 9.question:#

How many stamps did Bella buy? ** Let S be the total number of stamps bought.** How many rose stamps were bought apart from truck and snowflake? ** Let TR be the trucks bought. Similarly, SF is likewise the number of snowflakes bought.** Then S =11 + TR - SF ** From here solve for TR.Question Factors and MultiplesHow many truck stamps? ** Therefore, we get 11 + TR - SF = 11 + 5 - 9 = 12 = TRQuestion factors and multiples? ** Thus, 11 snowflake and 12 truck stamps. How many trucks are in total? ** Thus, Multiply 12 x 11 = 132, stations total.The answer is 132.question:#

How many snowflake stamps did Bella buy? ** Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.How many truck stamps did Bella buy? ** Also, Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.Also, Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.Bella bought 13 truck stamps, Bella did not buy rose stamps.Subtract 9 truck stamps from 13 truck stamps. ** There are 12 truck stamps after subtracting 9 truck stamps from 13 truck stamps in total.Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.Subtract 12 truck stamps from 14 truck stamps. ** There are 2 truck stamps after subtracting 12 truck stamps from 14 truck stamps.She bought 2 truck stamps, which means she did not buy rose stamps.Total number of stamps#

How many truck stamps did she buy? ** Let T be the number of truck stamps Bella purchased. Then 11 + 9(T) + 13(T+ snowflake stamps) = 78 snowflake stamps - As shown in the diagram. 11 + 9T + 13(T+ snowflake stamps) = 78 snowflake stamps - 11 + 9T + 13T + 13 snowflake stamps - 8 + 13T = 8 snowflake stamps + 11 + 9T + 11 + 9T + 13T stamps - 8 + 13T = 8 Snowflake stamps + 11T - 8 + 13T = 11T + 9(T â€“ 12) + 30 = 78 Similarly, 16 rose stamps were purchased. Thus the number of all stamps purchased were, 78 + 16 + 1 = 96 The answer is 96.question:#

How many rose stamps did Bella buy? ** Let R be the total number of rose stamps.Then, the number of truck stamps was 9 - 5 = 4. So the number of truck stamps is 4.Write an equation ** Bella bought twice as many truck stamps as she did rose stamps. Bella purchased 9 truck stamps and thus purchased 9 * 2 = 18 truck stampsHow many truck stamps did Bella purchase? ** To ensure the truck design is twice as many as the rose design, the value of R must be 18 * 2 = 36.R = 36stampsThe answer is 36.question:#

How many stamps did Bella buy in all? ** Let the number of snowflake stamps be 2 * s. How many truck stamps are there? ** The number of truck stamps are 9 more than snowflake stamps.  9 TNT, which gives 9 * (STUFF) = T.Let S be the number of snowflake stamps, T be the number of truck stamps, and R be the number of rose stamps. Write an equation ** Then 9 * s = T. There are 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.  [13 - R]T = minus 13.Divide by 2 ** 2[T * (minus 13)]/S = minus 9/2.Answer: 56.Is it a carbon copy?This signal indicates that the#

Define the following variables:  let x - number of snow flakes let y - number of truck stamps let z - number of rose stampsHow many snow flakes did Bella buy? ** Then the number of snowflakes bought by Bella would be 11 * x.Write an equation ** So the equation would be 11*x+11*x = 23 xHow many snowflakes did Bella buy? **  So equating like terms gives 11*x = y.Subtract 11 and regroup 11 - 11 = x  So the answer is 14.question:#
