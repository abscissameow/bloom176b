How long is the combined teaching experience? ** Let x be the combined time spent teaching in years.10 years less x years = 40 years10 * (50 + x) = 40 * x ⇔ 53x = 433 ⇔ x = 4.The combined teaching experience is 40 years divided by 4 = 10 years.The answer 10 years.question:#

The combined experience of James and his partner is proportional to the sheer numbers of years he eats.  The more years he eats, the more years his combined experience is. Dividing52 by I will we will be able to find what the combined experience of 1 person. ** And 40/10=2..If we sum them ** Then the combined experience of James and his partner is proportional to I * 10 and James * 40.Writing the equation ** Thus, the proportional constant is I * 10, because this is what you add to the number of years James had to get the number of years.James need to be raised to the power of 0 because EASY we solve this y'all!!!!question: 2 bottles of juice are being mixed together to make 1 bottle of new juice.

James teaches for 40 years.From 1976-1994 James worked 2 years on Kodak, and Together his total work experience is T.  T = Work Wisroung at 1 company work experience + Work Experience at 2 companiesKingergThen Darlene worked at 3 companies 1986-1983, 1983-1976, and 1976-1974 for 2 years eachHis total work experience is 10+total= Work Experience above 1 company work 2 +Work Experience at 3 companies Thus Kingerg's total work experience was thus (10 +total) *(40 /10) = 40 yearscette experience was not received entirely at once.  say James for 20 years and Darlene for 30 years so that they remain colleagues 40 yeE James dr Coworkers with Bob for 10 years.When did they sever as coworkers? ** They severed as coworkers in 1994.Question came from here:  (Dam#

Experience by James and his partner = 40 + 10 - 40 = 10.Their combined experience = 10.The answer is 10.question:#

Define a variable R for "Rows" and define a variable C for "Columns".Combine terms as necessary ** ACR = 1500  As written we have:  CR40000 / AC / R1000.Divide by 1000 ** Hence, 1500 /1000  But we can eliminate the factor of 1000 because there can be 1000 rows or 1000 columns.  Let n equal 1500 / 1000 = 15.  So we have:  150n / C / RTake the square root ** Therefore, the combined teaching experience is √(150n / C / R) years.The answer is 27.5 years#

How many years has James been teaching? ** By definition, a minus sign signifies filling in the missing number. Therefore, the years of teachers can be found as 40 - 10 = 30 years of teaching.What year was it that James first started teaching? ** In order for James to still be teaching 10 years ago the year of his dedication to teaching was 2007 plus 10 = 1977.James was teaching for 1978 years.How many years did James marry in between his first year of teaching and the current year? ** 80 - 10 = 70 therefore his 10 year of marriage happened at 1948.What years hasJames been married? ** 40 - 20 = 20 many years.The year of James first year of teaching (1977)&The year of James 10 year of marriage (1948)It#

How long has James been teaching? ** Let T be the combined duration James and his partner have taught.Then 10 years plus 40 = 50 years.How long has James been teaching? ** Since James and his partner have taught for 50 years so each of James and his partner has taught for 25 years.How long has James been teaching? ** James has taught for 40 years because he has taught for 40 years and has partner has taught for 10 years less.The answer is 40 years.question:#

Write an equation ** James has taught for 40 years.Or 40 * Y = total yearsJames partner has taught for 10 years less.This is a word equation Now we know what values to put into the equation to make it equal 40.So James has taught 40 years Subtracts the value of the constant or 10 years this is to make zero 10 - 10 = 0 so Y= 30* how long James partners time is  he has practiced or spent time teaching for 30 years together.Thus 30 = the total amount of time spent teaching.The answer is 30 years.***

In 40 years, he has taught 36 of them with his partner who has been teaching for 10 years less.Question 1 ** 36/(40 - 10) = 52/(60)Question 1 ** 52 x 60/60 = 72.The answer is 72.question:#

Their combined years of teaching is 40 + 10 = 50 years.The answer is 50.#
