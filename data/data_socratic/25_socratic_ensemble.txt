Do True or False ** True.How many did Ralph not hit? ** So the number of balls he does not hit = 150. Divide both sides by the number of tennis balls on both sides to simplify (Removes decimal points.) ** and thus a 100 / 150 * 75 / 150 ** gives 75 / 50 = 150 / 75 tennis balls.Brack both sides to obtain the sum ** and so 75 + 75 * 50 / 100 * 50 / 100 = 75 + 15 = 90 balls.The answer is 90 balls.question:#

How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** Then the number of balls did Ralph not hit would be 100 x 2/5 - 75 x 1/3.Simplify your answer ** By distributing the 100 onto the 2/5 and 75 onto the 1/3.Ralph not hit ** Then if the number of#

Number of tennis balls that Ralph managed to hit is ** x + y = 100% = 1 - z.So there are 3 groups of tennis balls remaining after Ralph hits all of them ** Only if you have a rational number for x, y, and z, can you sum them.So first group that he hits is ** Then the second group he hits is** And the final group he hits is** First he hits** He hit 2/5 of x times 100 is 20 times 100 is 200 balls.Then he hits** So he hits 1/3 of z times 75 is 15 times 75 is u times 75 is ** And he hits y of y so y of 25 is 5 u times 12 is 60So combined him hitting the 3 groups * all 180 of them were hit.Only the unhit balls were not hit ** 15 + 60 u = 75 + 40 u.15 + 60 u = 75 - 15 = 60 - 15 = 45u = 15/\60Let x = 15 and then y#

Define a variable ** Let X be the number of tennis balls that did not make it.How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** ** Stopping after 75 balls, 75*1/3=37.Adding 100*2/5+37=78.Of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them.Of the next 75 balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them.The number of tennis balls that did not make it is 78 - 175 = -88.The answer is 88.question:#

He managed to hit 2/5 of the first 100 tennis balls. Then he hit 1/3 of the remaining 75 balls.Combine constants and rewrite as a new fraction ** 100 + 75 + 175 = 325.325/25 = 10.2.Squaring both sides ** So the equation is: 10.2.10.2.10.2.10.2/275 which is the same as ۷۴% * ۷۳/۲%.Question? ** The answer is 75.The#

Define a variable ** Let x be the number of tennis balls that Ralph did not hit.How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** Of all the balls 100 + 75 = 175 balls not hit.How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** Ralph hit 2/5 of the first 100 balls loaded x + 75 $$ / = 2/5 x + 75 $$ / = 125 balls not hit because 75 balls hit.How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** 100 2/5 + 75 $$ / = 100 2/7 + 3 $$ / = 3 1/2 + 75 75 = 92.5 ballsnot hit.How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** Therefore the number of tennis balls not hit by Ralph is 92.5.The answer is 92.5.question:#

How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** And Ralph could have achieved this improvement by going from 100 balls not hit to 75 balls not hit. 125 balls not hit to 63 balls not hit.Remember ** How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** Therefore, he could have improved his score by going from 125 balls not hit, to 63 balls not hit.The answer is 63.question#

The number of tennis balls not hit is the number of tennis balls he loaded; 175 - 2/5 * 100 -1/3 * 75 = 175 - 26 = 159How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** 159 divided by 75 produces 227.Therefore, he not hit 227/3 tennis balls.The answer is 227.question:#

How many did Ralph not hit? ** Let C be the number of tennis balls that Ralph did not hit. 175 - C - (100 * 2/5) - (75 * 1/3) = 100 balls.How many did Ralph not hit? ** Combine two numbers to produce 80 - C = 100 balls.How many did Ralph not hit? ** Simplify to get 9 * C = 80 balls.How many did Ralph not hit? ** Divide each side by 9 to get C = 80/9 = 10 balls.The answer is 10 balls.question:#

How many tennis balls were left? ** Ralph successfully hits 2/5 of the first 100 balls, 1/3 of the next 75 balls, and the remaining tennis balls. And so of the first 150 tennis balls, 2/3 were hit. Thus the total number of tennis balls would be 150 x 2/3 = 150 x.90DO NOTHING else mentions the rest of the problem.How many tennis balls did Ralph not hit? ** Let S be the expression.133  So the expression S = 150 – 90 x.30topic  = x +.30 Mississippi  = 150 – 90 x.30.Did something go wrong? problem? ** n = 90 +.30.The final answer is 90.The final answer is 90.31#
