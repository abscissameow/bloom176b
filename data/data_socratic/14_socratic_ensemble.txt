Suppose the amount of time needed to read a page is P.Use the Power of 0.5 ** That is, let's assume that 0.5p time is needed to read half a page.Therefore, the time needed to read 8 pages equals 8p.And the time needed to read 120 pages equals 120/n*p.Define a variable ** Let x be the amount of time in hours taken to read 120 pages.Substitute numeric values ** Therefore, 120p/x = 60p.Divide both sides by p ** So 60/x = p.Therefore, p = 60/x.Now use the Power of 0.5 again ** And the amount of p is 0.5p.Substitute numeric values ** Thus, 120/x = 0.5p.Consider another value for x ** Now consider another value for x so that 120/x = 0.5p.And the answer is 120/x = 0.5p. question
