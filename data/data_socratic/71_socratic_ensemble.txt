cried with happiness. Journey to the Middle Ages This year, a group of third- and fourth-grade teachers called Beginners English Language Learners will embark on a story-telling adventure to meet medieval knights on tour. We plan on travelling with them into a past time where speeches were formed from rhyme and audience participation is whole-hearted. We will be listening to stories that teach us about noble knights, brave kings and dark queens.Excerpts from poems and stories will give students an opportunity to use words that sound like “out loud” as well as to recognize and acquire new vocabulary. I hope to use the ideas I've found here to help us become familiar with the attitudes and vocabulary of the time. Reading and harmonyChoosing a royal courtMany English teachers by trade#
