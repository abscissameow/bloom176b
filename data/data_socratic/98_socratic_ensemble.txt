The number of gumballs that Hector purchased is the sum of the gumballs gived: 4*(Hector) + 2*(Todd) + 2*(Alisha) - 5*(Hector - Alisha).  Hector gives 4 gumballs to Todd, for a total of 4 gumballs won.  The sum of wins is then 6 + 4 gumballs = 10 gumballs in total.  Thus the number of gumballs that Hector purchased is 4*(Hector) + 2*(Todd) + 2*(Alisha) - 5*(Hector - Alisha) = 10 gumballs. The answer is 10 gumballs.All those who attempt#

* The number of total gumballs that Hector purchased is 26.give the number of gumballs that Hector purchased to Todd ** minus 1 since Tdis was the number of gumballs that he gave to Todd.to Alisha he gave ** twice as many as he gave to Todd, twice as many is 4 + 4 = 8.to Bobby he gave ** less than he gave Alisha, so to Bobby he gave the 4 less than 4 times is 8 from Alisha is 8 - 8 = 0.The number of total gumballs that Hector purchased is 26.question: Ashley won a rally licensed dart board for her birthday, and she played with Mark for 1 game per hour until she lost.

Hector must have purchased 16 gumballs.  16 gumballs are divided as follows.  He gave 4 gumballs to Todd, then he gave twice 4 gumballs = 8 gumballs to Alisha, and then he gave 5 gumballs less than eight times three gumballs i.e. 5 * 4 = 20 gumballs to Bobby.Number of gumballs left to Hector:  16 - 4 - 8 - 5 = 2Number of gumballs purchased:  Twenty = 2 * 10The total number of gumballs purchased comes out to be 28 gumballs.The answer is 28.question:#

What is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased? ** Let x be the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased.The extra gumballs that Hector gave to Bobby are  ** The extra gumballs that Hector gave to Bobby are 4*(5-4x) = (4-1)*(5-4x).5x – 16x = 16-x ** Let y be the number of gumballs Hector purchased.5x – 16x = 16-x ** Setting the expression equal to 16-x simplifies the expression to 5x = 18-x.18-x = 5x ** Subtracting -x from each side produces 18x = 5x ** Factoring out the 18 from each side produces 18x / 18 = 5x / 5 ** Solving for x produces x = 60gumballs that Hector purchased.The answer is 60.question:#

Define the value of  ** Let x be the value of Hector purchase.Total number of gumballs that Hector purchased? **  Let y represent the number of gumballs Hector gave to Todd.The instructions call for 14 gumballs to be given away.  Separate the variables then y = x/4Let *** Let u be the number of gumballs that Hector gave to Alisha.Then the instructions call for 2x gumballs to be given away.  Then 2x = y*5.Make the equation *** So Incuding the x gumballs Hector left for Bobby, 2x + u = 5x.Make the equation *** So the total gumball purchases value is 2x + u + x = 5x.Make the equation *** Therefore, 4x = 2x + u + x.Make the equation *** Simplify ** Thus 4x = 2x + 3x 3x = 4x - x.Divide both sides of the equation by one of the variables, or 3x ** Hence 8/3#

If Hector bought 4 gumballs, then there are 6-4 = 2 gumballs remaining.Therefore, Hector gave 4 to Todd assignment sample questions about algebra ** So giving twice as many is giving 4 x 2 = 8 gumballs to Alisha.** then giving 5 less than 4 X 2 is giving 8 - 4 x 5 = 6 gumballs to Bobby.Therefore, Hector gave 4, 8, 6 gumballs respectively to Todd, Alisha, Bobby.The answer is 18 if he purchased 6 gumballs as he gave 2 to Todd.This was 10 questions from#

** First lets define variables  Let H be the total number of gumballs purchased.Let T be the number of gumballs given to Todd Let A be the number of gumballs given to AlishaLet B be the number of gumballs given to Bobby ** How many gumballs did Hector give to Todd? ** Then H remaining = T -4 = 0 - 4 = - 4. simplify ** Therefore the original answer would be T - 4 = -4. ** Hector gave twice#

Add the values of numbers we know as variables ** We know the sum of gumballs initially: 4*4+6 = 16.Add gumballs Todd gets to the ones initially ** We know this since Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd.He then gave Alisha 3 more gumballs than he gave to Todd ** Hector gave twice as many as he gave to Todd so he gave Alisha 2*4 + 4 = 6 gumballs more than he gave to Todd.Gumballs Bobby gets to the ones initially ** We know this since Hector gave 4 gumballs to Bobby.Hector gave Alisha 5 less than 4 times as many as he gave to Todd ** So Hector gave Bobby 5/4 * 4 = 12 gumballs less than he gave Alisha.We still do not know the total number ** We need the sum of the gumballs initially + all the gumballs given away, no more or no less.We add the same value as before,#
