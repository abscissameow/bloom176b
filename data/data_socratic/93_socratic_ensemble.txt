John ordered 1000 pounds of Beef at 8 = $8,000 total. He also ordered twice 1000 pounds of Chicken at 3 + 3 = $6,000 total.Add the two values ** Then Grand Total Cost = $8,000 + $6,000 = $14,000.Divide by 100 ** So Grand Total Cost per 100 pounds = 7 = $1,400 per 100 pounds.The answer is $1,400.question:#

What is the cost of the chicken? ** Let c be the cost in dollars of the chicken.How much did the chicken cost? ** Let x be the cost in dollars of the chicken.Then 1000 x = c x 3Total amount of Food ordered 9 000 ** So c x 3 = 3 000.What was the cost of the chicken? ** Then the cost of the chicken is 1000x = 30003000 = x 1 000,000 = 300c = 300 = 3x 10 0 = 20 00How much did everything cost? ** Therefore, the cost of the chicken is 20 000.The answer is 20 000.question:#

How much chicken did John order? ** Let C be the pounds of chicken.Then 1000 = C x 3 pounds per chickenHow much chicken did John order? ** Then he used twice that amount of chicken however 3 x 1000 / 2 = 500 pounds of chicken.How much chicken did John order? ** Therefore, the half of the chicken he used was 1000 / 2 = 500 pounds of chicken.How much chicken did John order? ** Or, the number of pounds of chicken is C = 1000 x 3 / 2 = 500.How much chicken did John order? ** Thus, the number of pounds of chicken that John bought is C = 1000 x 3 / 2 = 500.The answer is 500.question:#

To find the total cost of the chicken and beef, we need to look for the sum. * Beef: 1000*$8 + ** Let x be the cost of beef.Therefore, ** Let y be the cost of the chicken or the remaining part of the cost.Therefore, ** 800*$8 + 200*$3 = x+ y.Before these, there would have been two separate Areas one with separate notation for beef and one like the chicken. This implies that he ordered 800 pounds of beef and 200 pounds of chicken that way.So to find the value of y, we take the amount of beef and subtract this from the value of all of the beef and chicken. So x +( 800*x + 200*y) = 1000*$8 + 200*y.  If we add the cost for both, then we get 800*x + 1000*$8 = 800*$8 + 200*y to replace the total cost of notations.The answer is $1200.#

How many pounds of both beef and chicken were ordered? ** Let ones for beef be ** Let ones for chicken be ** Write an equation for the number of pounds ordered.1000 * 8 = (1000) * 3 Therefore the number of pounds ordered is ** Add the variables for beef and chicken.2*w + 2 * w = 1002.Simplify ** If the x is now modified, all cows must be modified.Therefore, the number of pounds is twice as much.The answer is 0 pounds.question:#

How costly was the chicken? ** Let c be the cost for the chicken.Then the cost of the chicken would be (1000*2)*c = 3000*c. Then on the original practical equation, this simplifies to 3 * c = 8*1000 + 3000 * c.Then the cost of the chicken would also be 3 * (c/8) * 1000 = 3000 * (c/8) = (3000 * c) / 8The cost of the chicken is 3000.divide through by 3 000 000 000 000 000 000.The answer is  300 000 000 000 000.#

Determine the equation ** John ordered 1000 pounds of beef so 1,000 * 8 = $8,000 total.How much did everything cost? ** Also, he ordered 250 pounds of chicken so 250 * 3 = 750 total.Define a variable to create an equation ** Sum the total bond cost for both ** 4 = Total cost of beef cost and chicken cost.Divide by 2 ** 2 = Total cost of beef cost / chicken cost.How much did everything cost? ** Therefore, the cost of everything cost ** 2 * 250 = 500.The answer is 4,000.question:#

How much did the beef cost? ** The beef cost 1000 x 8 = 8000.How much did chicken cost? **  The meat thread cost 1000 x 2 x 3 = 18 000.The answer is 8000 + 18 000 = 26 000.correct = trueincorrect = falsetrue = correct#

How much did the beef cost? *  5080 cows had to be slaughtered.How much did the beef cost? ** To clarify, this means that he would need to buy 1000 x 8 = 8,000 pounds of beef.How much did the beef cost? ** So the price of the beef comes to (8,000 pounds) ($8 per pound) = $64,000.Total price for the food ** The total price would be (8,000 pounds) ($8 per pound) + (8,000 pounds) ($3 per pound) = $64,000 + 24,000 = $80,000.The answer is 80,000.#

The price of 1000 pounds of beef is 8 * 1000 = 8000.The price of twice that much chicken is 3 * 2000 = 6000.So, the total cost of the food is 8000 + 6000 = $12000.The answer is 12000.question:#
