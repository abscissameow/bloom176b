If Bow and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas = 4 pieces.If Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas = 3 pieces.5/4 + 3*27/4 = 6 (NOTE: * indicates multiplication)3*27/4 + 4/4 = 4 + 3 = 725% + 75% = 5/4 + 3/4 = 1 + 1 = 21/2 = 1 + 0:5/2 = 0:5/4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4/4How many pizza pieces are left uneaten? ** 1/1 + 1/2 = 2 pieces are leftover.The answer is 2.question:#

Define a variable ** Let x be the number of pizzas that are left uneaten.How many pizza pieces are left uneaten? ** The total pizzas cut into 4 pieces is 4x.Define a function of xAllows us to plug in values into the function to see how the function looks for a specific value of x ** Bill and Dale do not eat 2x pizzas. As such, the total number of pizza pieces left uneaten is x + 2x = 4x.The answer is 4x.question:#

Alternatively, how many pies remain? ** Utilizing our 2 equations (items eaten = total/4), we can solve for the unknown which they have named forget. $0.25 * 7.5 + 0.5 * 2.25 = 8.375$ reflect on this 2 equations 6 figures, it works! $0.25 * 0.5 + 0.25 * 0.5 = duplicates 0.25 * 0.75 = 2.25] + 0.75 = 3.25 = 8.375]Someone else wrote a homungous amount of decimals, THANKS LOOOOSE!!.Due to it being an "easy" question. The answer is 13.3 pieces#

Let n be the number of leftover pieces.  If Bill and Dale eat 50% of n then another n/2 of the leftover pieces, then n = n/2 + (2- Ann and Cate eat).How many pizza pieces are left uneaten? ** So, the expression 2-10n = 4In a fee pizzas are 4 pizza pieces. 53 - 4 = 5 pizza pieces.The answer is 5.question:#

How many pizzas are left over. ** There were 4 pizzas so there are 4 remaining.Each pizza was cut into 4 pieces. Then, 4 pieces + 4 = 8.Ann & Cate ate 3/4 of pizza pieces. ** So 3/4 * 4 = 24.Accordingly, 8 + 24 = 32 pieces of pizza remain 1/2 of pizza. ** Thus 5 * 4 = 20.did Bill & Dale eat? ** They ate 1 pizza piece.Therefore, 8 + 20 + 1 = 33 pieces of pizza remain. ** Thus the total number of pizza pieces left is 4 - 33 = -21.The answer is -21.When you lose weight, your body's metabolism burns more calories.

Each pizza only had 16 slices, so this means 16 * 4 = 64 slices in total.During the division, 50 percent of 64 = 64 * 50/100 = 32 slices and 75 percent of 64 = 64 * 75/100 = 48 slices.The leftover is 3 slices, meaning that Bill and Dale ate 32 slices and Ann and Cate ate 48 slices.Therefore, 3 slices from all were not eaten and are uneaten.The answer is 3.question:#

Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4 pieces.  Suppose there are P remaining pieces. ** Let x be the number of pieces eaten by Bill.** Let y be the number of pieces eaten by Ann.** Let z be the number of pieces eaten by Cate.** Let t be the number of pieces eaten by Dale. **Then Bill and Dale eat x + y pieces and Ann and Cate eat x + y + z + t pieces. ** Plug-in the known variable amounts for each execpt x and t:We have x + y pieces eaten by Bill and Dale apples and x + y + z + t pieces eaten by Ann and Cate. ** Combine known multiplicative ingredients:We know that Bill and Dale will together eat 2x + y of the pieces and Ann and Cate will together eat 3x + y + z pieces. ** Add up these known multiplicative components:Acknowledgements The author would like#

How many personal pizzas did each buy? ** Ann bought 4/4 = 1 pizza piece.Bill bought 4/4 = 1 pizza piece.Cate bought 4/4 = 1 pizza piece.Dale bought 4/4 = 1 pizza piece.Let x be the number of pizza pieces.  Bill and Dale ate 50%. ** Let y be the number of pizza pieces eaten. Then y/2 = x/2.How many pizza pieces are left? ** Then there are 3 pizza pieces remaining.Let z be the number of pizza pieces. Then 3/4 x = y + z. Vary the letters on the stoichometric coefficients. ** Then 3x = 2y + z.Balancing the coefficients of y and z. ** Thus, 3 = 2 so y =1.Divide by 2 ** Then x = 2 how many pizza pieces are left.The answer is 2.question:#
