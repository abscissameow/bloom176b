The third equation says it gained (4340/2) + (1840/2) - 320 pounds.Solve ** so that the bear gained 1760 pounds.The answer is 1760.question:#

Define a variable ** Let S be the number of pounds the bear gained from small animals.How many pounds did the bear gain from berries? ** Let B be the number of pounds the bear gained from berries.Then the bear needs to: ** It needs to weight 1000 poundsSo it needs to gain: ** Its total pounds gained from all its feeding = 1000 pounds.It gained one-fifth of the remaining weight it needed to gain from berries, thus it gained 500 pounds from berries.Thebear gained two-fifths of the remaining weight it needed to gain from acorns, it gained (1040 - 10 * 53/535 -1200/220)/100 = 40 pounds.The other pounds it gained would be the result of (1200 - 20 - 40) * 100/20 = 1880 pounds. (Error the rest of the question)The answer is 1200+500+1880#

How many pounds did the bear gain eating small animals? ** Let x be the number of pounds gained from eating small animals.**** When x is = 14, a quater of rest of the number i.e, = a fifth of 1000 made from berries.***** 550 gained on acorns from anutary will be equal to twice of acorns gained = gains on acorns + gains on summer = x = a fifth of 1000 + 550 = 1000 + 550 = 1500 + 550 = 2650 pounds.  Carlas solution is slightly wrong but it is still close. The correct answer is 2650.question:#

How many pounds gained making small woodland animals? ** Because it needs to gain 1000 pounds by the start of winter, we have 1000 = weight at the beginning of winter - weight at the end;How many pounds gained from salmon? ** Salmon made up half of the remaining weight the bear needed to gain so it needed to gain 1000 - 500 = 500 pounds.Make a proportion using the berries, woodland animals and salmon ** A fifth of the weight was gained in summer so 10 pounds was gained from berries. Twice that is: 20 poundsFrom salmon... ** Salmon made up half of the remaining weight the bear needed to gain so it needed to gain 1000 - 50 = 950 pounds. What salmon made up was 950/20 = 46.75 pounds.Write a proportion to find weight gained eating#

Loosely rewrite the question. The bear needed to gain 1000 pounds from berries, acorns, and small animals.The bear needed to gain 1000 pounds from berries and small animals. ** Therefore, the number of pounds from berries is 500 pounds.The bear needed to gain 1000 from small animals. ** Thus, the number of pounds that small animals gave it was 250 pounds.The initial number from acorns was 250 pounds.The number of pounds the bear needed to gain from acorns was 250 pounds. ** Therefore, the total number it ate was 250 * 2 = 500 pounds.The bear ate twice as many from acorns * it ate from berries. ** The number it ate of acorns is 250 pounds.250 * 2 = 500 pounds from berries ** Bear ate 100 pounds from acorns. ** Bear ate 100 * 2 = 200 pounds from small animals.#

Define a variable a ** a is the number of pounds gained eating small animals.Then we have 1000 + (2500/5) = 1000 + 375 = 1250.Now we have 1250 + (1000-250) = 1250 + 250 = 1350.Now we have 1350 + (1000/2) = 1350 + 500 = 1500.The answer is 1500.root@rfvserver:/home/#

How many pounds did it gain eating small animals? ** Let us define a variable x so that x is the amount of pounds on weight gained eating small animals.How many pounds did he gain from berries? ** It gained a fifth of the weight, that is 5/100 pounds = 0.05 of the weight.How many pounds did he gain eating small animals? ** As it gained 5 pounds of berries, and 5x the number from small animals, 2x of the weight comes from acorns.How many pounds did he gain eating small animals? ** Then the pounds gained from small animals is (250/2x) = 50x, thus the pounds gained eating small animals is EQUIVALENT TO x * (50/2) = 50x.Thus multiply by 12 ** 50x x (12x) = 100.012x Where x...100...??** And therefore,#

1. How many pounds did the bear gain eating small animals? Let A represent the number of pounds that it gained. Once the acorns and salmon weight has been subtracted, berries have still made up 15/20 of the total pounds needed.Thus, A = 15/15 * 1000.label the equation ** 2. However the number of berries it gained has already been found. And thus the number of pounds gained by eating small animals can be found by dividing this into the final total weight needed.When you label your equation, make sure that your variable starts with a capital letter, as we have done for ** 3. Simplifying can be done a lot to improve your equations.When these steps have been applied and written down, the equation would be ** 4. Divide both sides#

Summer gains: The number of pounds needed to gain is 1000 pounds, and the third of that gain is won by eating berries, thus by division we get 1200 pounds / 3 = 400 pounds.Do late summer eaters: Summer ate 400 pounds sprinting, ate 400 pounds.In autumn eaters: Autumn ate 200 pounds from acorns, ate 400 pounds. Lateral autumn ate 400 pounds.So weight consumption: The number of pounds of food consumed by the bear is 400 pounds + 200 pounds + 400 pounds = 800 pounds.Small animal weights eaten in autumn: The number of pounds consumed by the bear is (800 pounds) * (1 / 5) = 400 pounds.Question: Spring should gain: Spring back: Spring added 400 pounds during the summer by running, and 400 pounds by eating#

Define variables ** Let S be the number of pounds gained from salmon, let F be the pounds gained by eating woodland animals, and let OAP be the pounds gained from eating acorns and pigs.Implement the total equation ** 0.9*S + 0.4*F + 0.5*OAP = 1000.The highest percentage is 5%, so use variables with decimal percentages ** 0.5 is the decimal fraction amount of the weight gained eating meat. The 0.9 is the decimal fraction amount of weight gained by simply eating food, and 0.4 is the decimal fraction amount of weight gained by eating woodland animals.Translate the percentage into partial fractions and gather variables with similar base ** 0.9*S = 0.9*0.5*S = 0.45*S = 250*S = 0.4*F = 0.4*250/4 = 0.625 *#
