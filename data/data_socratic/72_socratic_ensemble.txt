** There are (4 + 6 + 3)(1/2)(1/2) of an FOOT ** so there are (4 + 6 + 3)(1/2) = 4/2(4 + 6 + 3) = 8 FOOT of water in the aquarium.Divided by ** Most people expect an FOOT to be equal to a cubic foot but it is not so here we will convert an FOOT to a cubic foot and novate that it to FUFT3 ** So there are (4 + 6 + 3)(1/2) = 4/2(4 + 6 + 3) = 8 FOOT of water in the aquarium.Divided by ** Most people expect an FOOT to be equal to a cubic foot but it is not so here we will convert an FOOT to cubic foot and novate that it to cubic FOOTs One FOOT is 2 times the area of a square that is 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch ** an FOOT is 4 * 5 * 3/64 = 12.6 cubic inchesOne cubic meter is ** 30 * 3 = 3ft * 3ft * 3ft** ft4 * 5 * 3/64 = 3 12.6 cubic inchesOne#

How many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium? ** Let C be the number of cubic feet of water in the aquarium.Write an equation ** Thus the problem is C =?Cubic F = length x width x height ** And, C = (4 feet)x (6 feet) x (3 feet) = 48 cubic feet of water.Simplify ** Divide by the constant ** C = 48/foot = 8 feet.The answer is 8 feet.question:#

How many cubic feet is half the aquarium? ** Let x be the number of cubic feet that is half the aquarium, then 4 x 6 x 3 = 144 x 1/2 = 72 x 1/2 = 72/2 = 36.Water Spilled out of the aquarium ** Let y be the number of cubic feet that was spilled out of the aquarium, then 36 - y = 3,126 /2, 6 x 3 x 4 = 4x3 (2x2 + x2).Solution (2/2)  question what should i put in this sentence2;2;2; 2;2; 2Vee  question what should i put in this sentence?Ã©s; question what should i put in this sentence? 3; question what should i put in this sentence? 2; question what should i put in this sentence? question what should i put in this sentence?question: Ravenous Thirds release their 7th album called Raining Blood followed by...answer: Hillbilly#

Then the number of cubic feet of water in the aquarium is 6/52.Cube it ** The volume of the aquarium is 6/52 cubic feet, which comes to 1 cubic foot.Subtract it ** If you subtract the original 4 cubic feet from the 1 cubic foot remains, you get 3/52 cubic feet.Multiply it ** Because the volume of the aquarium is 3/52 cubic feet, multiply that by the long, wide, and high dimensions of the aquarium, and you'll derive 27 x 52 = 1344.Add it ** So the number of cubic feet of water in the aquarium is 1344 cubic feet.The answer is 1344.question:#

How many cubic feet will water in the aquarium contain? ** Let w be the number of cubic feet that water will contain. Then w is equal to 3 * w.How many cubic feet of water will be in the aquarium? (It is 3 times)The answer is 9.question:#

Nancy wanted to halfway (1/2) of the aquarium filled up.How many cubic feet of water were in the aquarium before it spilled? ** Let it be G = 4 * 6 * 3 = 72 cubic feet before spilling.How many cubic feet of water were in the aquarium after it spilled? ** Let H = (1/2) G be the amount of water before it spilled.If the aquarium was full, before it spilled, how many cubic feet would have been in the aquarium? ** So as the aquarium is spilled, H = 1/2 G is the amount of water before it spilled.Howd many cubic feet would have been in the aquarium? ** And before it spilled, the aquarium was H - 4 * 6 * 3 = 12*0 *6 * 3 = 156 cubic feet.How many cubic feet were in the aquarium? ** Therefore, the number of cubic feet of water was H - G =#

The tank is filled by half ** Let w->w/2. Aquaries are filled by extra ** The total amount of volume that is in the aquarium is tripled** The answer is (w/2)*(3)=2w, for the length.Wet due to the middle **#

How many feet of water were in the aquarium before Nancy left? Well, half of 4 feet is 2 feet.Then since 2/3 of 6 feet by 6 feet by 3 feet is 3 feet, there are 3 feet of water in the aquarium after the cat knocked over the aquarium. It only took Nancy 1 minute to fill up the aquarium again. How many gallons of water are in the aquarium? Well it is 14 minutes until the aquarium is full. How long did it take Nancy to fill up the aquarium again (and the cat knocked it over)? Well it took her 1 minute to fill up the aquarium. So how many minutes took the cat to knock over the aquarium? Well, it took Nancy 1 minute to fill up the aquarium. So what time does 1 minute first put in the aquarium (since 1 minute is 20 seconds)? Well#

Define a variable ** Let L be the length of the aquarium, and W represent the width of the aquarium and H the height of the aquarium.  Create an expression with variables and their lengths to represent one cubic foot of water.Let us write the length part as something of the form 2 * L.Likewise, the width and height are given similarly in this form.Therefore, the length part is 2 * L.There are 2 such 2 and we will have an index of length plus height plus width.Does the equation make sense? ** Here is how many cubic feet in the aquarium!We write area * height.Now we want to apply this equation to the aquarium!We start with half of the length, half of the width, and half of the height.So we have:2 * L - 1/2 * L - 1/2 * H= H * 1/2 area *#

How many cubic feet of water were in the aquarium? ** The number of cubic feet of water was 2 * 3 = 6 cubic feet.How many cubic feet of water was in the aquarium? ** It took 2 * 3 = 6 cubic feet of water to make an aquarium 3 feet wide.The answer is 6.#
