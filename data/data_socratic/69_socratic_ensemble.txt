How many arms do the animals Carly collected have? ** 7+14+5=30.How many arms do the animals Carly collected have? ** Making the symbols represent the correct data we have 30+5+7=42.The answer is 42.The final step involves plugging in the answer to your#

First, divide to problem up.Multiply 7 starfishes by 5 arms each ** 7 * 5 = 35 arms of starfishes. Add the arms of the seastar **  35 + 14 = 49 arms in total.The answer is 49 arms.question:#

The total number of arms in 7 starfish with 5 arms each is 5 * 7 = 35 arms in total.The total number of arms in 7 starfish with 5 arms each and one seastar with 14 arms is 35 + 14 = 49 arms.The answer is 49.question:#

How many arms do the starfish have in total? ** 48 + (7 * 5) =  How many arms do the seastars have in total? ** Because she collected one seastar, there would be one set of 14 arms. The total number of arms would be one set of 14 + 1 set of 7 =  The total number of arms in Carlys collection is We get the answer by adding the two answers together. The total number of arms is 72 which is correct.#

Repeat the answer, because you are well not clear and varied.Run in starter training again.#

The combined animals have 7 * 5 + 1 * 14 = 31 arms in total, under the condition that each starfish counted as 5 arms and each seastar counted as 14 arms.The answer is 31.question:#

** Let A = The number of arms the animals she collected. ** The starfish had 5 arms each, so she had 5*7 = 35 arms total.** The seastar had 14 arms so it had 14 arms total.Adding everything ** So the number of arms of the animals she collected was 35 + 14 = 49 arms.The answer is 49.question:#

How many arms do the animals she collected have? ** Let A be the total number of arms the animals collected have.We define logical expressions ** Then the number of arms A equals 7*5+1*14:  Combine like terms ** Thus A equals 7*(5+1)+14:  Let B be the expression 7*(5+1)14:  Simplify the equation ** Therefore A = 7*5 + 7*14 + 7 + 14 equals 54 arms.The answer is 54.question:#

Let a be the number of arms of the animals she collectedand rounded answer up to the nearest whole number. Thus the number of arms= 7 + 5 + 14 * a * a * a *#

The total number of arms ** The number of arms =  seastar + starfish x 5How many arms do the animals she collected have in total? **  13 armsThe answer is 13 arms.question:#
