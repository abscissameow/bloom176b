The weight he would be on the day of the fight is given by w / (factor) ** The weight he would be on the day of the fight is given by w / (3/ month) = 97 / (3/ month) = 19 kg. The answer is 19.question:#

R *** Bigfatnumbershop.caHow much will the boxer weigh on the day of the fight? ** Let t be the number of months the boxer needs to lose the 3 kg. Then the boxer will weigh 97 - 3t = 93t kilograms on the day of the fight.How much will the boxer weigh on the day of the fight? ** Let W be the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight. Combining like terms produces 93t + 97 = 184 (97 is between the terms so it can combine) 187 kilograms.Simplifying 187 t = 184, so t = 93185. However, 1 month is 30 days, not 93 days so we can round up to t = 30.Thus 30 = 184 x 30 days Thus 525/2 = 187. Therefore, the boxer will weigh 187 kilograms along the way until the day of the fight.The answer is 187 kilograms.document.write(

Espinoza is 98 kg at four months so 3 kg per month would be 97 * factoring numbers edu2go.com/lesson-book-lesson-9 © factoring numbers edu2go.com/lesson-book-lesson-9 © 3 = 318 kg on the day of the fight.Since he is on a diet that allows him to lose 3 kg per month, he will lose his weight under 3 per month.Thus, we take 97 to the power of 11. 9711 = 4325Now take 97 - 4325 = 4420Therefore, Espinoza will weigh 4420 kilograms on the initial day of the fight.The answer is 4420.question:#

Daily weight loss (DWL) is 3 kg per month.  My assumptions were that the boxer weights 97 kg at 4 months. While I wanted to find out 5 months later (the day of the fight), I wanted to use a multiplication/divison problem which would require the days (4 days) to be in units of months.Thus A days * B units/day = D months * C units/month = D * C/ A * B = total Loss in Months in Kilograms we're after.On 5/4 months day, there will be 4 units of month = 4 * 30 kg / 95 kg * 3 kg = 60 kg would be lost5 months so calculator gives 86 kg as answer.the answer is 86kg.question:#

How much will he weigh after 2 months on the diet? ** 97 - 3 = 94.How much will he weigh at the next month? ** 94 - 3 = 91.How much will he weigh after 4 months from the name of the fight? ** All 3 months at 91 - 3 = 88 kg.How much will he weigh on the fight? ** So he would be 88 kg on the day of the fight.The answer is 88.question:#
