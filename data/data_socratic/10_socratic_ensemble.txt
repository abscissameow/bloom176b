How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years? ** Thus the number of people on the ship the monster ate is above is 47.The answer is 47.question:#

56 How many people were on the ship the monster ate? ** Or (847/2) - 847 + 756 = 756.How many people were on the ship the monster ate? ** The initial ship had 847 people so there were 756 people on the ship the monster ate.The answer is 756.#

The number of people was halved  189/2 = 94/4 = 19.The answer is 19.question:#

How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years? ** Let x be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.How many people were on the ship it ate in the second hundred years? ** Since each ship had twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people doubled.Thus, the third ship had 8x people.The answer is 8x.The answer is 8x.The answer is 847.the day#

lets three hundred years ago, there were people on the ship the monster ate? ** Based on the statement given, each ship has twice as many people as the last ship.How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years? ** And the ship will be in the hunderd year.  the monster ate are the lost people.The answer is 848.question:#

The amount would be (847 + 2(847 + 2(847 + 2(847 + ….. > thus the amount = 847 + 200 + 400 + 800 + 1000 = 847 + 33554432 = 33554433 possible Jacksons - 1.The answer is (847 + 33554433) - 1 = 360287970235 and that's an infinite number.Can you#

How many people are on each ship? ** The total number of people across all ships is 847.Divide by two ** The average number of people per ship is 47 and there are 47 ships.How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years? ** Then the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first 100 years would be 47 * 100 = 4700 people.The answer is 4700people.The answer is 4700.question:#

How strong was the monster? ** So in the first hundred years a ship was blown up by a monster of strength a hundred.How many people were on the ship? ** For each hundred years pass the ship gets blown up by a monster whose strength is two times more than it was the next hundred years ago.How many people ate per hundred years? ** So the number of people lost then was 1700 one a century.The answer to the question is 1700 people.question:#

Over three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people.Let x be the number of people eaten by the monster. Write an equation ** Starting with a very large shipwreck, the equation becomes 47*x + 0.05 + 48*x = 847.Simplify and isolate x ** properties of equality: x * 50 = 847. Divide both sides by 50 ** x = 12847/50 x = 17*Simplify ** Therefore, x = 17.The answer is 17.question:#

From centuries #1 to #2, the population doubled ** So the ship had 1/2 the population + 1/2 the population = 1 times/50 as many. The repeating pattern would be x₁ *1+ 2x + 1.From centuries #2 to #3, population doubled ** So the ship had 2 times + 1/2 the population = 2 times/50 as many people. The repeating pattern would be x₂ *2 + 2x + 1.From centuries #2 to #3, population doubled ** So the ship had 2 times + 1/2 the population = 2 x/5 = 2 x/10 as many people.The answer is 847/10.question#

three hundred years = x The monster ate 847 people ( people/year)Where x is the 100 years the monster feeds.847 people x 100 years = 84700 person of the 1700 total. Recall the formula for binomial coefficients.The number of people on the ship = highest-order term.84700 people / 100 people year = 84700/100 = 84700 rounds = 84700 principals / 2 = 43200 personsor effectively the first age of the herb.Here is a rubric designed to improve student performance on raising to a one-and a two-digit power, or exponentiating. ( equations) ( other than addition formulas that express a number as a power of another number Using the same idea above we can find 24 in another way.24 is equal to 2 to the 3. Let's write this#

How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years? ** Let A be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first 100 years.Then the number of people on the next ship over is 2 * A.Note that the monster ate 847 people.Now try to solve a system of two equations to bypass the original problem* 47 people = A * 2people ** Thus, A = 24 people.In the first hundred years, there were 24 people on the ship the monster ate. The answer is 24.Note: The poster previously said the ship would be#
