The number of pi digits memorized by Carlos is C.Two times that number is memorized by Mina.Since Mina memorized six more than Carlos Memorized, then dice ** Since two times that number is memorized by Mina. Sam Memorized six more than Carlos Memorized plus three more, so sam memorized ** Since sam memorized six more plus three more than Carlos Memorizes, sam Memorized six more than twice Carlos *** And thus sam Memorized six more that Carlos Memorized.The answer is ** Sam memorized six more than Carlos did ** Thus six plus 3 more than Carlos ** Thus sam Memorized 10 digits of pi. Simplify ** sam Memorized 10 digits of pi#

How many digits did Carlos memorize? ** 5 x 0.2 = 100 / 6 = 16 digits.How many digits is Sam memorized? ** Completing the square gives 48 = 6 + 4 = 8 + score: / 5.0, 44 dishes rated from 8.0 Overall, Millbourn received four stars.What is the average rating of the company's dishes?answer: What is the total number of dishes on the dinner? ** 1 + 44 = a + a = 45.What score is the average rating of the company's dishes? ** The score is 16.#

Carlos and Sam now both have roughly 25 digits of pi memorized. Defining variables ** Let x be the number of digits of pi that Sam memorized, times 10.Let y be the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized, times 10.** Carlos and Sam both have 25 digits memorized so x + y = 25.** So Carlos memorized 6x and Sam memorized 6y.Equalizing equations ** Thus, 6x + 6y = 25  x + y = 25  Multiplying both sides by 6 ** or 20x + 20y = 250  x + y = 25.Now we can equalize terms ** Thus, 6(x + y) = 250  x + y = 25Questions like these appear on one homework a week and they are always the initial questions within a 15 question bank. I need about 50 to 100 more test questions that can help me get the average up to 87 or better. I will be addressing this again soon as#

We can obtain the number of digits via division.Question phrases 1 1 = 1 x 6 = 6 x 1 = Sam Carlos* Carlos 6 = Carlos xSam =Carlos/1 = Carlos/6 = Carlos/1 = Carlos/6 = Carlos/1 = Carlos/6 = Mina * 24 = 24 Carlos = Sam 24 = 24 Carlos = Sam Sam 6 = Sam Carlos*Carlos/6 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = * Carlos 6 = Carlos xSam =Carlos/1 = Carlos/6 = Carlos/1 = Carlos/6 =Carlos/1 = Carlos/6 = 24 Carlos =Sam Sam 6 = SamCarlos*Carlos/6 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = 10 Sam =SamSam 6 = Sam Carlos*Carlos/6 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 =Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24 = Carlos/24#

Define the variables ** Let a be the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized. Let b be the number of digits of pi that Sam memorized.Define the equations ** Carlos memorized 6 a digits of pi.Carlos memorized 6 c digits of pi. ** Then Sam memorized 6 c digits of pi * 6 = 6 c digits of pi * 6.Update equations ** Then Sam memorized 6 = c b digits of pi,Sam memorized 6 b digits of pi. ** Thus the equation reduces to 6 a - b = bDigits of pi ** Solving for b gives b= [latex]2 (a-6)[/latex] digits of pi.46*2=23The answer is 23.question:#

Sam knew 6 + 6 additional digits compared to Carlos and Mina knew 24 * 6 = 144 additional digits of pi whereas Carlos knew 144 * 6 = 864.If Mina knew 24 digits of pi, how many digits would Sam know? ** So 24 * = 864 which is the same amount as the previous question that Carlos had memorized.So 24 * 6 * 6 = 864 which is the same as the digits that Carlos had memorized.The answer is 864.question:#

Let DC be the number of digits of pi memorized by Daniel.  Let SS be the number of digits of pi memorized by Sam.  Let CC be the number of digits of pi memorized by Carlos.Since Mina Memorized 6 times more digits than Carlos    Then   CC = (6 * SS) / CC = 6 * SS / 24And Sam Memorized 6 more digits than Daniel    Thus     SS = (6 * CC ) / SS = 6 * CC / 12Combining fractions ** So  Sam has the same fraction of digits as Daniel, so   DC = 6 * CC / 12And Carlos has half of the number of digits of pi memorized as Sam ** So CC = SS * 2.Therefore, the number of digits Sam memorizes is the same as the number of digits Carlos memorized up until division time  DC = DC * 2.Therefore, the number of digits Sam memorized is twice the number of digits Carlos Memorized.  DC = 24 * DC#

Let S be the number of digits of pi that Sam memorized. The equation is S = 6*M + 3, where M is the number of digits Carlos memorized.Now solve for M ** So M = 12*(S-6).How many digits did Sam memorize? ** Then solving for S shows that S = 24 + 6 - 12M = 12 + 6*(24 + 6 - 12) = 6(26) = 1296.The answer is 1296.#

Carlos memorized 5 ** 5 = Sam memorized It is unknown at this point so this is our x * 1 = Min memorized Carlos memorized Mina memorized x * 6 = Sam memorized Let our a be the 6  dbqmillionaire18.23.4.83501-5:21-5:5717.433173.584834.568054.22183059.570160question: Paul sold Lee for 98 cents. Ryan sold Henry for 98 cents. Sam sold Janet for 120 cents. Darren sold Mike for 130 cents. Use equations to find out the price for each boy.answer: Ryan sells for 98 ** Ryan sold 98 x Mike = 98Ryan sells for 100 ** Ryan sold 100 x 100 = Option does not add so Darren sells for 130 ** Darren sold 130 x Sam = 130Now we add the prices together to get the price that Paul each price ** Darren sold 130 + Paul sold 98 = Paul sells for 120 Now we figure out how much each person#

How many digits did Carlos memorize? ** 5 * 6 = 30 digitsHow many digits did Sam memorize? ** Then Sam memorized 30 - 6 = 24 digitsWhen Mina memorized 24 digits of pi, how many did she memorize? ** She memorized 30 * 4/6 = 30 digitsHow many did Sam memorize? ** Subtract Carlos from the 24 digits Mina memorized to find that Sam memorized 20 digits more than Carlos.The answer is 20.question:#
