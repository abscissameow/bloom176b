** It has gone 5 + 8 + (.05) = 13 meters after the 3rd turn.How far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Then 23 = 13 + 4 = 11 + (.05)Thus 23 = 11.85 - (.05)How far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Combining units produces 23 = 11 + (.05)So.05  ** Thus 23 = 11 +.5MetersHow far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Thus the value of the answer is 88.5 meters.The answer is#

** Let T be the distance after the 3rd turn.The total number of meters through the ring is ** Let x be the total distance in the ring.The next turn is the 4th turn.. ** The car emerges from the 4th turn. Therefore, x is the distance after the 4th turn and is equal to the total distance in the ring.Define a variable ** The first turning mistake turns left so the total distance becomes x - 4 meters.Define a new variable ** Let y be the largest multiple of 5 greater than of x - 4 meters as the first part.The turn from 2nd turn to 3rd turn ** The total number of meters is the difference between 23 meters in the ring and 15 meters in the third turn.The first turn from 1 to 2 ** 5 meters is the remaining distance by#

It has to travel 5 + 5 + 8 meters after the 3rd turn.It has to travel 5+5+8 = 22metres rups after the 3rd turn.The answer is 22.

According to the drawing, after the 3rd turn the car travelled 5+8 = 13 meters (5+8+5 = 16 - 16 + 5 = 13).How far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Consider a number ** Let C be a number defined within the tunnel.The total distance the car travels is 23 metersIt has travelled 23 - 13 = 10 meters at the 3rd turn.How far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** According to the picture, Joseph signed 3x meters (x meters on the left, 2x meters on the right =3x meters left and right = 4x meters = 4 x 23 metersAfter the 3rd turn, the car travelled C meters more than 4 * 23 so it had to travel 4*23 - C =4*23 - 4 * 13 = 6 * 2 meters.Thus, the answer is 6 meters.The answer is 6 meters.#

Then ** At the 1st turn the car has traveled 5 meters.At the 2nd turn the car has traveled 8 meters.At the 3rd turn the car has traveled ** The distance is measured up until the 3rd turn.23 metres - 8 meters = 15 metres** So ** So the distance the car has to travel after the 3rd turn is 15 meters.The answer is 15.question:#

It takes 23 meters around the ring from the 3rd turn to reach the 4th turn ** 240 x 5 = 23. (combining multiples)That means the car traveled 45 meters after the 3rd turn ** route by 23 meters takes 45 - 23 meters for 3 turns in total.Thus the route initially took 45 meters for the 1st turn and 5 meters for 2nd turn, so 45 + 5 = 50 metersMy question is:How much does it take to complete 1 actual dog track? (175 meters)I intend to find a speed for the car. ** How far does the car travel after the 1st turn to reach the 2nd turn? 242 - 175 meters in 175 meters - this is the speed of my first variable that I will eventually use to multiply speed. x = 50 kilometers / hour now for my answer, which is x * 3 + 8 = 53 kilometers / hour#

Compute the distance the car travels before the 3rd turn. ** Therefore, the car has to travel a total of 23 meters and 8 meters was traveled after the 3rd turn, so the car has traveled 8 meters less.How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Therefore, the car has to travel a total of 2 * 8 = 16 meters.Comtinue Carrying Calculations... ** the first turn, the car traveled 5 meters, so far fter the 3 turn it should be 23-5 meters.The answer is 19.question:#

So long after the 3rd turn, it starts going around the ring again, and must travel the remainder of the distance. Define a variable ** Let x be the distance of travel after the 3rd turnHow far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** And the distance is now 23 - x.How far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Then a time of 23/x seconds has passed. Solve ** And let x be the duration of travel.Multinomial Expressions ** The value of x is determined from 23/x.Simplify the numerator ** Which is 2x + 13/x = 23/x.Multiply out the fraction ** Dividing top and bottom by 2, we find that x = 13/2.Find value of x ** So the car traveled 13 meters before it exited the ring.The answer is 13.question:#

How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Let x be the distance traveled from the 3rd turn.Then, x = 23 -  The distance traveled from the 1st turn - the distance traveled from the 2nd turn.The distance traveled from the 1st turn + the distance traveled from the 2nd turn = the distance traveled around the ring.The distance traveled around the ring equals the total distance traveled after the 3rd turn.The number of right-hand turns is 5 meters.The distances traveled from the last turn to the exit is a total of 4 * 5 meters = 20 meters.How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** ** Therefore, the distance traveled after the 3rd turn would be x =23 - (4 * 5) + =23 - 20 + =#

The sum of the elements in the second row is 56. ** As people cross out a number in the 1st row, e.g. they cross out 7, everyone knows that one more of the numbers on the 2nd row must be crossed out. So the sum of the elements that are left must, therefore, be 56.Step 3 Write a linear combination equation ** 8x + 5 = 56 x = 28.In the 3rd turn, the car travels a further 23 meters. ** Thus after the 3rd turn the car still had to travel 23 - 8 - 5 = 8 meters.Step 4 Solve for the original length of the car. ** The equation above now reads 8.(23-8-5) = 23 Step 5 So how much further does the car have to travel after the 3rd turn? ** Therefore the car has to travel 23 + 8 + 5 = 34 meters further around the ring#
