Let A be the number of ml of salt that Jack will get.Define a variable ** Let s be the volume of the sea water.Add water to equal volume ** The water has been evaporated and Jack wants to find out how much salt was originally in the water.If so then The Bucket couts 2 liters so meno s 2 L = s. Then the left is 2 L - s.Define ** And then the number of ml of salt that Jack will get is 20% of the number of ml in the bucket = 0.2 A = s/2L.Therefore, the problem becomes A - 0.2 A is 0.8 L or A = 4 L.Since 4 liter of salt is sixteen cups of water.The answer is 16 cups.question:#

How many mls of salt in 2 liters of seawater? ** 2 x 0.2 = 0.4.How many mls of salt in 2 liters of sea water or what is the concentration, the twice the answer? ** Thus, the concentration of salt in the seawater is 0.4.What is the concentration of salt divided by the volume of water?#

Jack gets salt, water, and saltwater combined. Define a variable ** Let x be the number of liters of saltwater that Jack gets from seawater.Fill in the blank ** There are x liters of x - what will the 2 liters of seawater become?Simplify the fraction ** Bring the seawater fraction to the other side of the equation.Subtract seawater ** After subtracting the minimum amount of seawater the new equation is x (2/5) - 2 =?Divide by 2/5 ** And solve for x. Thus, x = 5/5 = 1 liter higher liters ** And Jennifer has higher liters are more current (in Jennifer's dish), which is 1 liter higher. The answer is 1 liter.question:#

Calculate the percentage of salt in the seawater by multiplying 100% by 20%. ** 80% = 20% x 100%How many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates? ** A liter contains 1000 ml of seawater. With 20% salt, then 48 ml of salt by evaporating 2 liters of seawater.So 48 ml worth of salt will result from 2 liters of 20% saline water which is 1/6 liter. 2 liters is the next larger multiplier of 1/6 liter available. (If the question had used 4 liters of 250% saline water, then 1/9 liter would have resulted. 1 liter is the next larger multiple of 1/9 liter available.)Therefore 48 ml of salt will result from 2 liters of 20% saline water which is 1/6 liter.The answer is 48.question:#

How many liters of salt will Jack get? ** Thus similarly Jack lets the water evaporate in the sun so all the water and salt evaporates.Jack wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. There are 20% salt and N is the number of liters of salt.Let x be the number of liters of salt recovered. There is 2 liters of seawater collected. Replace the values in the equation below.2 * 0.2 = N * x * 1 / 20. Question: x / 2 = N / 0.2.Thus the liters of salt will be N / 0.2.We know that N lgures in the 25th place. We are looking for an 54 in the denominator.The answer is 54.question:#

Jack collects 2 liters of salt water so the volume is...(ml) = V = 2 * 1 liter = 2 liter.If the water is 20% salt...(mol) = M = V * concentration = 0.2 * 2 liter = 0.04 mol.The answer is M = 0.04 mol = 0.04 * 6.02 x 10 23 single#

Let the water evaporate. Let the salt be collected.Before evaporation ** Let b be the volume of salt collected before the water is evaporated.Then evaporation ** The volume of salt decreases by half while the water dries.Why? ** It is because half of the water vaporizes and half remains as water. Half of the left half is solid salt.The volume of salt ** Let cL be the volume of salt left after evaporation.Then evaporation ** The volume of salt decreases just as much as did the water. That is because the salt is as much in the water as water is in the total mélange.The volume of salt ** Let2F be the volume of water remaining after evaporation.Then evaporation ** The volume of salt is half of what would remain in the water that did remain#

Take an empty cylinder,let a be the fraction of seawater in the cylinder.So the number of Liters is 2L = 2*10^-3m^3.The number of ml of salt is S = 2 * 10^-3m^3 * 0.2.Therefore, the number of ml of salt is 2m^2＊5%, so 2m^2 is cm^2 and 5% is ‰ so 2m * 0.05 is 0.1.Therefore, the number of ml d... <a href="https://www.quizzilla.com/php/u/02/135923.php" target="_blank">see all the questions and solutions from 2a</a>

If x% salt really means x/20, then figure out how much salt is in his water. ** he lete x be the number of milliliters of salt.So 2x = 2 * 0.6 = 0.8. ** It says that the number of milliliters of salt is 80% of the amount of water.Now, work it out from 8. **8x = 8 * 0.8 = 6. * 9x = 9 x 0.8 = 7.9. Question: Jessie collected 12 coins to begin making change for store purchases; each coin had a different face Value. How many combinations of coins is Jessie able to arrange?Jessie collected 12 coins thus 12 coins will be able to arrange.question: Karen completed a list of numbers by filling out the multiplication table three times. She wrote the units digit of the product of the first two numbers in the first column. She then multiplied the units digit of#

Define a variable ** Let S be the number of ml of salt that is produced when all the water evaporates.To find S melt the ice ** In order to know the amount needed to bake a cake he needs convert liters of salt into grams of salt -- 2 liters = 2000 ml = 2000 milliliters.L.O.W. ** Thus to go from milliliters of water to grams of salt one needs to divide by the equivalence of 20H2O per gram of salt. L.O.W. ** The definition of grams converts glass into grams powder.Thus, in order to convert milliliters to grams using 1gm of salt in a liter, one must divide 20 by 500 -- L.O.W. ** Then since 2 liters are 20% salt, one must multiply by 20.L.O.W. ** L.O.W. ** Thus, 40,000 divided by 20 is 2000.Let X be the number of 1ml of#
