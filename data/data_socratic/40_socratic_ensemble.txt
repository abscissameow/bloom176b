Example ** Thus, 12 is greater than or equal to 10 so he would receive a 5% discount on 3 tickets equal to $10 * 0.05 * 3 = $1.50.$$\begin{align} What does 12 surpasses 10? &12 \ge 10 && S & parkir澳大利亚元 10 ਦਿੰਦੀ-1} \\ What does 12 tickets is greater than or equal to 10? & prices 12slipping bar 10 & \\ \\ Therefore,3 tickets greater than or equal to 10 produce 1.50 & 3slapping slip sandwichQurry p & && \\ \hline When does the expression equals 30? | & && \\ 5--10. & && \\ \hline Therefore, the answer is $23 yếtphophones在哪里? & 5 --10 && \\ \hline Thus, a ticket worth $23 x 50 = $13050 & & && $$The answer is $130$.question:#

Applied Solution ** Let D be the discount, and t be the number of tickets purchased. Then t - 10 = D.Simplified Solution ** D(12 - 10) = t-50. Simplify the sum and subtract to produce t = D(50 / (12 - 10)), which simplifies to t = D(90 / 8) = D(22.5) = D(2.25).Clear Answer ** The total payment made by Mr. Benson is $40.#

Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets. So we need to simplify the decimal fraction representation of 12 and express it as a mixed number. ** 12 = 1000 / 10 [and the decimal point goes on to the side]Make a mixed number by erasing the unit fraction. ** Thus 12 = 0.12 Make a fraction by raising the power of 10. ** From the last question, we have 10^2 =1000Make a mixed number by erasing the unit fraction. ** Thus 12 = 0.05.Both calculations made by erasing the a · x · 10 unit fraction.Now we have 12 tickets at reduced rates. ** 12 = 15% discount. Reduce the numbers of tickets to its actual amount using the flat rate. ** 5% discount is 0.05 [Now the decimal operator goes first] Double this rate to multiply it with the reduced amount. [Hence, 2 · 0#

If Mr. Bensons ticket was $40, how much did he receive in change? ** In order to determine the number of tickets, we must have a way to convert the amount received back to dollars. Let M equal the amount in change.How much did Mr. Bensons ticket cost? ** Then Mr. Bensons ticket cost M/400 = $80/4 = $20.Therefore, how many tickets did Mr. Benson buy? ** Since he bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10, then the tickets that exceeded 10 was too discounted in addition to the other tickets purchased.Therefore, the number of tickets that were not discounted was 12 - 10 = 2.Therefore, the tickets were:  $10/2 * 12 = 6 tickets  + $2.50*(10 - 2) * 2 = 4.50 ticketsThe answer is#

Define a variable ** Let x be the final cost of the ticket so Mr. Bensons pay equals 40 + 0.05x2x=80, then the first part of the equation above equals 40 and x = 80 - 40. Thus, x = 40.Mr. Bensons pay in all equals 80 + x + 0.05(40 - x)= 40 + 40 + 0.05x = 80 + 100 + 40 = 200.Simplify the terms on each side ** Then adding 10 to each side helps.Therefore, 100 + 40 + 0.05x = 80 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 0.05xThe answer is 200.question:#

The price of a ticket is $40. ** A ticket costs 4 cents, since we are thinking in terms of dollars and cents. 12 tickets costs 12 * 4 = 48 cents. So we are looking for the discount, which is 48 - 12 * 0.05 = 48 * 0.95 / 100 = 4.8 cents. The price of the tickets came: 48 + 4.8 = 52.8.The answer is 52.8.question:#

Every ticket costs 40 - 12 = $28 money.Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all?** Let B be the number of tickets bought that Mr. Benson payed for. So 12 - B < 10,SO buy price = 40 - Banswer: So the total cost is (4 * 40 - 12) * 12 * 0.05 = 4800 money.Question#

Let it t be the amount of the money that the person pays for ** And  h be the amount of money the person gets back.Write an equation ** And  p = 40 is the price of the ticket.How much did Mr. Benson pay in all? ** So the tickets cost 40.He paid 12 x 5 ** On the other hand, he got 12 x 5.Thus ** And  Then the amount of money Mr. Benson paid is t2*12 - 25.The answer is 225.question:#

The concert ticket cost $40. ** Thus each ticket costed 40/12 = 3 dollars.Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets ** Let x be the amount of dollars that Mr. Benson paid.Discounted 5% per ticket ** Then 3 * 12 = 30 x - 5% x = 0 x - 5x] = 0] = 30 - 5] = 23 dollars.The answer is 23.question#
