Define the following variables and set the given number 16 as the value of n. ** Let Sams number of skips be equal to n+1 in the first round.Let Jeffs number of skips be equal to n in the first round.Let Jeffs number of skips be equal to n+3 in the second round.Let Jeff skipped n-4 times in the third round.Let Jeffs number of skips be equal to n+1 in the last round. ** Then, in the first round, Sam skipped n+1 times while Jeff skipped n times.In the second round, Jeff skipped n+3 times while Sam skipped n times.In the third round, Jeff skipped n-4 times while Sam skipped n times.In the last round, Jeff skipped n+1 times while Sam skipped n times.Computing the average for Jeff ** Therefore, Jeff skipped (30 + n + 48 +#

How many times did Sam skip in the first round? ** Sam skipped 5316 times in the first round.How many times did Jeff skip in the first round? ** Jeff skipped 12 times in the first round.How many times did Jeff skip in the second round? ** Jeff skipped 3 skips on the second round.When did Jeff skip the same amount of times as Sam? **  Jeff skipped the same amount of times as Sam in Round Two.How many times did Jeff skip in Round Two? **  Jeff skipped 3 skips on the second round.How many times did Jeff skip in the three round? **  Jeff skipped the same amount of times as Sam in Round One.So How many more times did Sam skip on the third round? **  So Sam skipped 3 more times on the third round.Thus How many more times did Sam skip in the third round? **#

How many skips did Sam complete in each round? ** Let S be the amount of skips that Sam completes per round.How many skips did Jeff skip in each round? ** Let J be the amount of skips that Jeff completes per round.Then S + ((S/3) + (4 * S)) = 16The first equation simplifies to S = 32And the last equation simplifies to J = S/4 = 8 * S/8  so J equals 16.How many skips did Jeff skip in each round? ** Thus the number of skips Jeff skipped per round was J = 8.The answer is 8.question:#

outline calculation below ** The average number of skips can be computed as 16 + (3x8)/12 = 16 + 4x6 = 40 / 3 = 12 skipsThe answer is 12.question:#

there are four rounds, the average number of skips per round is 16scenario‚Äù: Assuming that Jeff skipped an average of 10 to win, multiply 10 by 4 rounds to find that there are 40 skips total. This means that Jeff skipped 10 more than Sam in the first round. Sam skipped 10 + 1 = 11, so that means he skipped 1 more skip than Jeff in the third round.The answer is 40 skips * 4 rounds = 160 skips vs 37 skips= 158 skips vs 37 skips = average skips per round = 16 skips / average - 16 skips = 68 skipsThe answer is 16 skips.question:#

How many skips did Jeff complete? ** Then Jeff could have completed anywhere from 1 to 10 skips. Write an equation. It's a = x. That's the average, a, times the number rounds, x. How many skips per round did Sam complete? Then the actual number of skips completed by Jeff can be anywhere from 16formula ** To find the average.Substitute the known values into the 273+2=28Write a range. ** So the number of skips Jeff completed can be anywhere from 16(s) to 32(s).question: Tim and Tom are playing a game with 2 dice with both 2dice having different sides equal to each other. They threw the dice together and each saw a different face on their side.(a) If the sum of the two dice sides is 20, and the highest face value is 6, what is#

Jeff got tired and only completed ** Thus the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 16 / 4round= (but this is not the right answer. Try to do walnuts#

How many skips did Jeff have in the first round? ** Let x represent the number of skips that Jeff made in the first round. How many skips did Sam have in the first round? ** Let y represent the number of skips that Sam made in the first round.Then x - y = 1.How many skips did Jeff have in the first round? ** Five skips for Jeff is x = 5 and eight skips for Sam is y = 8.How many skips did Jeff make in the second round? ** Then five skips for Jeff is x = 5 and seven skips for Sam is y = 7.Then x - y = 3.How many skips did Jeff have in the second round? ** theres 44 skips in the second round so 2x = 44.How many skips did Jeff have in the second round? ** And Jeff skipped 3x = 12 times in the second round.How many skips did Jeff have in the#

Average skipping for each round ** Let S be the average number of skips in each round and for Sam.If Sam skips 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff? ** Therefore, Jeff skips B*S.Addition and subtraction ** Because the number of skips that aggravated Jeffs knee is X -S + 4.Simplify ** Thus simplifying expression is B*SX - S = 4Reducing constants into the formula ** And solving yields B*SX = 4Asking ideally, ** Thus, X = 4S - B + 16.Calculate to answer ** Thus, X = 4(4 - B) + 16.The answer is 16.question:#

If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff? ** Let S be the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff. How many times did Jeff lose to Sam? ** Then S=10 with a total of 16.The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff could be calculated as Sams total of 16 skips can be split into 2 rounds-5 skips in the first round and 7 in the second round.** Jeff lost to Sam in round 1 by 5 skips and beat Sam in round 2 by 3 skips so he appeared to beat Sam by 2 skips rounds a total of 0.5 which divided by 2 skips gives 3 skips.Thus Jeffs total of skips is 11 with 2 skipped against Sam in round 1 and 3 extra skips against Sam in round 2 giving to 5#
