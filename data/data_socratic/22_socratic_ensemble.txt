x is the number of letters in Sammias last name.y is the number of letters in Bobbies last name.z is number of letters Samantha needs to remove from her last name for her last name to have twice as many letters as Jamies last name. How many letters is Jamies name? ** z = 2*y,so x=z-y Therefore, 2y=z-y so taking 2x from y and adding it to y gives z, so 2x+y=z or x+y=z/2.How many letters in Samantha? ** This means that 2y = z - y. equationconverting to math equations you have 2x ** Let solve for y which means 2x = z -y.equation x = z - y so therefore x = z-y - z = z - 2xnew equation ** So 1z = 2x - 2z and dividing both sides by 2 gives x = z/2Let y = z/2 the problem becomes ** or 2y = z - y.equationconvert#
