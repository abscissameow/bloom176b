This is a very easy question because we can just add and subtract. Let A represent amount of time in minutes spent practicing the violin. If lets say Carolyn has more than 30 however to try and figure out the amount of time spent practicing her violin.How much time does she spend practicing her violin in a month with 4 weeks? ** Let B represent amount of time in minutes Carolyn practiced in the month of 4 weeks since we know the amount of time in a month is 28 days and days are in tbls or days in each month. We know from the restrictions that (28 * 4) = weeks.Therefore, (A + B) = (20 + 30) * 4 = 336 minutes a week = 7.2 hours a week.How many minutes do you spend practicing your violin in a month with 4 weeks? ** We saw above#
