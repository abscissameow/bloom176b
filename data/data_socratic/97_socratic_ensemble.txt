Define a variable that represents books shelved to the cart. Let x = books shelved to the cart.First populate the top section of the cart. ** Then she shelved 12  books + x = 20 books to the cart.First populate the top section of the cart. ** Then she shelved 8 + x = 12 books to the cart.First step to the answer!! ** Thus the number of books shelved to the cart in the first section of books plus the last section is 12 + 20 + x.Now the top section of the cart is empty! ** Subtract 12#

Written in an equation this is: 12 - 8 +(4x) + 4 + (6 - 5) = 4 + 5 = 9 x = 4) bookson the top of the cart. 4 is the number of romance books from the top of the cart. Half of the total number of those books is 2*4=16 total Western books. So there are 16 Western books on the top of the cart. The Western books are 16 + 5 = 21 altogether. There are also 4 romance books, 5 Westerns, 6 Biographies, plus the 4 books on top of the cart. This total is 21 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 35. The answer is 35 books.question:#

Define a variable X to represent the number of books that are shelved before starting.What is the total number of books? ** The total number of books are 12 + 8 + 4 = 22 books.Dividing by 5 ** Then, the number of books equal to 22 * 40/100 = 5 books.Adding 12 on both sides ** And defining A to be the number of books on the top so that A = 12 and 5 + A = 27 books.Dividing by 3 ** Grouping common denominators gives A = 13/10 books.Subtracting the next value from both sides ** And B will be the number of books with 13 books subtracted from 27 books.Simplify ** And 13 - B = 4 books.Add 12 to both sides ** And 12 + B = 16 books.Subtract 4 from both sides ** 4 - B = 8 books.Subtract 2 from both sides ** Then B =  2 books.The answer is 2 books.question:#

Initially, Nancy had 155 books on the book cart. Among them 12 history  books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books encountered on the top. Thus, the books on the top are  12*50% + 8*50% + 4*50% = 25.Bringing the other books on the bottom which were 5 Western novels and 6 biographies she came up with  5 + 6 + 25 = 36 books were left on the book cart. The remaining books on the bottom were (155 - 36) = 119.  So the number of books on the bottom section of the cart were 119. Initial number of books which was on the book cart = 155 = 25 + 36 + 119.Answer: Initial number of books which was on the book cart = 155 = 25 + 36 + 119.#

scottwilson: The King and Queen were driving their silver whale through the ocean. They were passing the Great Barrier Reef and saw a big whale in distress. The Mermaids explained that the OverCrafters were using underwater robots to grind up the whale and turn it into candles but the whale needed its fins to swim and eventually died. The Kayakers said they knew how to stop the grinding machines by cutting the power lines with their harpoons. The Queen gave her harpoon to the Kayakers and together they saved the whale.
