How many cans are holding 8 liters each? Disregard the cans that are full.This information is given as a ratio.Thus, 1 gallon is equally divided between 2 cans. Thus, half gallon to each can.Thus, 1 quart is equally divided to 4 cans. Thus, 1/12 quart to each can.Thus, 2/3 gallon to each can.Thus, 2/3 gallon to each can. Thus, 1.5 gallon to each can.Thus, 1.5 gallon to each can.Thus, 2 gallons to each can.times 12 to get the amount of cans.16 cans times 2 liters = 32 liters

so Essentially 8 liters or oil per can is another way of saying 800 ounces of oil. So 10 can 8 ounces or 800. 10 cans of 800 ounces is 8000 and there are 280 cans of that. Because there are 280 cans again divided by 800 ounces there are 320 ounces per can. questions * 220 / 10 = 24 ounces.10 cans * 24 ounces = 240 ounces240 / 280 = 80 + 1 ounce per can resulting in 81 ounces1 of 24 cans = 24 / 5 = 4 cans of 81 ounces.Oil is 8 times smaller, which is 8 milliliters or 0.04 liters per milliliter in containers.4 cans * 0.04 liters = 2. Sup am not * 4 equal to 4, so the left 4 liters equal to 2 liters per container?2 liters * 4 containers = 8 liters * 4 containers = 24 * 4 = 96 two containers and each container#

Explain the problem to verify that you understood it correctly. ** Start by defining two new variables. Let the first variable ** Let C be the number of cans holding 8 liters of oil.How much oil is each of the remaining cans holding? ** Let H be the number of liters each of the remaining cans were holding.Thus, 290 - 24C - 10H = 8.Simplify the problem ** Then solves C * 8 = H.Which form solves for H? Why? ** Therefore 3 * H = C * 8.Divide by 3 ** And then divides by 3 H = C * 8 / 3.Again divide by 3 ** Now 3 * C * H = 3 * 8.Divide by 3 ** And then divides by 3 C * H = 8 / 3The answer is 8.question:#

Define the variables ** L for the liters of oil in each of the 24 cans.C8 for the number of cans with 8 liters of oil.L10 for the amount of oil in the cans (which remained) that has a letter associated with it refering to the number of cans (which remained) with 10 liters of oil.L8 for the amount of oil in the cans (which remained) that has a letter associated with it refering to the number of cans (which remained) with 8 liters of oil.Lanswer: How will we approach this problem? ** We are going to solve it by place value.Total number of cans of oil is 24. **#

How much oil is each of the remaining cans holding? ** Let x be the amount of oil that each can is holding. How much oil is each of the remaining cans holding? ** Now x = 290 10 8.Write an equation ** Each bag should hold 3 and 3 liters of oil. 3 + 3 = 6 liters * 10 = 60 liters.Divide by 9 ** x x is 6/5.  x And, 6/5 is the same as 90/10.Therefore, the number of cans can hold 8/5.The answer is 8/5.QUESTION B TURNUP#

How much oil is in each of the remaining cans? ** Let A be the number of liters in each of the remaining cans. What happens when you multiple 8 by 10?80 liters ** Now 80 * 10 = 800 liters.Divide by 10 ** So 800/10 = 80 liters divide by 10 gives you 8 liters.Divide by 70 ** 8002108070 = 70, so 70 divided by 10 gives you 7 liters divided by 7 gives you 1 liter.What goes into a regular sized can? 2 liters ** So one of the regular sized cans holds 20 liters.So fill one of the regular sized cans* (24 cans multiply by 8 gives you 160 liters) ** Divide by 2 * 160 divided by 20 = 80 liters of oil in 24 cans.The sale from each of the cans is A =80 + 10 = 90 liters.Each can holds 10 liters + 8 liters ** So the 8 liters of#

Number of cans required ** To solve this equation, let C be the number of cans holding 8 liters of oil. How much oil is each of the remaining cans holding? ** The 10 cans holding 8 liters each have 80 liters total. The remaining cans hold 290 - 80 = 210 liters of oil. Let J be the number of remaining cans.The cans holding oil ** Thus 8 * C +J = 210litersThe cans holding oil ** 8 *10 +J = 210litersCans hold oil ** 10 * 8 +J = 210litersEffectively the same as ** Thus J = 20 * 8 - 10 = 80liters how mu oil each can holds ** Therefore each of the remaining cans holds 20 liters.The answer is 20. question 1: Let#

How many liters oil does 6 cans hold? ** 6 x 8 = 48 liters.How many cans are not holding 8 liters each? ** There are 290 - 48 = 232 cans.The amount of oil does 6 cans hold? ** So 8 liters x 6 = 48 liters every 6.How much oil is each of the remaining cans holding? ** So it is 48 / 232 = 2.35 liters per can.The answer is 2.35 x 8 = 19#

Let C represent the number of cans each holding. Then 8/3 = C.  Each remaining can is holding 10/3 liters. The answer is: 10/3 * 290 liters per can. So each#

If you have 10 containers with 8 liters each and 20 containers with 2 liters each plus 4 containers, then the total number of liters would be 290 + 20 + 8 + 4 = 344.How many containers are missing? ** Then the number of containers missing is 344-10x8 = 8.How many containers are missing? ** Then the number of containers missing is 344 \ 10 = -4 containers.How much oil is in each remaining container? ** Thus, the amount of oil in the remaining 8 cans is 8 liters per container = 88 liters.The answer is 88.#
